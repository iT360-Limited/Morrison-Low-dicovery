# Product Brief: Morrison Low

**Date:** 2025-11-20
**Author:** Sandi
**Context:** Enterprise - AI Automation Solutions

## Executive Summary

Morrison Low, a consulting firm operating across New Zealand and Australia, is embarking on an AI automation initiative to transform their manual, time-consuming business processes. The invoice automation project serves as their strategic entry point - a carefully chosen "quick win" designed to build organizational buy-in for AI adoption while delivering tangible efficiency gains.

The current invoicing process is highly manual, fragmented across multiple systems (ProjectWorks, Word templates, manual data extraction), and consumes approximately 4 hours per consultant monthly. This translates to roughly 1,400 non-billable hours annually across the firm - time that could be redirected to billable client work. The project aims to streamline this process through intelligent automation while maintaining the critical human oversight required for value-based billing and client relationship management.

This is Morrison Low's first step in a broader AI transformation journey, deliberately scoped to be achievable, demonstrable, and capable of generating momentum for future automation initiatives.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Morrison Low consultants and project support staff face a labor-intensive, fragmented invoicing process that consumes significant time each month and interrupts productive workflow. The current process involves:

**The Manual Workflow Reality:**
- Consultants enter timesheet notes into ProjectWorks (quality varies widely - some use full stops, others write detailed entries)
- Project support staff manually extract data from ProjectWorks into Word templates
- Each consultant receives a Word document with tables for all their active projects (10-12 projects simultaneously)
- Consultants must manually review: previous month's invoice notes (to avoid repetition), current month's WIP (work in progress), timesheet entries, project budget status, and statement of work
- They then manually craft 5 bullet points from potentially 30+ individual timesheet entries, transforming internal notes into client-appropriate language
- This narrative must justify the invoice amount while protecting proprietary consulting methodology
- The process involves constant toggling between ProjectWorks tabs, Word documents, and PDFs
- Project support staff then manually copy consultant-crafted notes back into ProjectWorks
- Manual adjustments required when billing amounts don't match timesheet totals (selecting/deselecting specific timesheet lines to hit target amounts)
- All data entry repeated across three offices (Auckland, Wellington, Australia) using identical processes

**The Human Cost:**
The first week of every month becomes "invoice week" - consultants must down tools on billable work to complete invoicing. As one consultant stated: *"It interrupts your flow because every month you have to just down tools and do this thing... if you've got 10 invoices or 15 invoices that you've got to generate, that's a real hassle."*

Estimated time impact: **4 hours per consultant per month**, or approximately **1 day out of 20 billable days**. Across the firm, this represents roughly **1,400 non-billable hours annually** - time that could be redirected to revenue-generating client work.
