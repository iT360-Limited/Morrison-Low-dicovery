# Meeting Transcript - Refined

## Session 1

---

**00:00:00 Speaker 1**  
My computer. I was prepared. I'm old school. You're old school.

**00:00:03 Speaker 2**  
I'm old school. Anne was just saying she feels bad for coming into an AI automation workshop.

**00:00:12 Speaker 1**  
With a piece of paper.

**00:00:13 Speaker 3**  
No, it works. She's welcome.

**00:00:18 Speaker 4**  
Look at that. Come laughing, because I'm taking a notepad into an AI meeting. If I write something down, it goes into my head. Me too. Very tactile.

**00:00:33 Speaker 3**  
I believe it's the way we learnt. I'm of that generation where we learnt with a pen, but then we became computers. I cannot think without this in my hand, even though I only use this.

**00:00:48 Speaker 1**  
Right. It's funny.

**00:00:49 Speaker 3**  
And I hardly ever check my notes. No, me either.

**00:00:54 Speaker 4**  
Write it down, it doesn't go in. I like this - you've got the IT360 side and the Morrison Low side. It's a bunch of lawyers facing off.

**00:01:03 Speaker 1**  
We could mix and mingle, but hey, we won't do that.

**00:01:06 Speaker 4**  
We'll put you in the middle, unless you want the end. No, no, we're good.

**00:01:09 Speaker 5**  
Good to see you, man. How are you? I'm good, thank you.

**00:01:12 Speaker 3**  
Rochelle, hi. Matt.

**00:01:14 Speaker 5**  
Nice to meet you. Hi, Matt. Sandy, nice to meet you.

**00:01:18 Speaker 1**  
Are we doing fireflies? We can. We definitely can.

**00:01:22 Speaker 3**  
I know we wanted to.

**00:01:25 Speaker 1**  
I've also got this little recorder thing. If that's okay, just in case, I can leave it on the table or just sit here. Whose fireflies is it? Between one of us.

**00:01:33 Speaker 4**  
Matt's the only one with fireflies. Matt.

**00:01:35 Speaker 1**  
Oh cool. Oh yeah, it's working.

**00:01:37 Speaker 4**  
We always do fireflies.

**00:01:39 Speaker 1**  
Do you? We do fireflies. We're trialing it across the business. We've got four users giving it a good go.

**00:01:46 Speaker 4**  
We trialed others first, didn't we? Fireflies versus - is that Plaud?

**00:01:51 Speaker 1**  
Plaud. This is Plaud.

**00:01:52 Speaker 4**  
And?

**00:01:54 Speaker 1**  
Honestly, they've all got their pros and cons. At the other day they're all sort of the same in terms of technology if you think about it. It was really just a speaker microphone and some kind of LLM or language logic model which does the transcription. And then there's a bunch of fanciness around the site. So this one's got a physical thing and an application on the phone. Fireflies has a login and you can chat with the transcripts. At the end of the day, it's all the same in quotes.

I'm seeing - and I'm actually going to do this ourselves for our own business - is build my own version of Fireflies. Because the ticks actually are all there. I've studied five at the top and the actual transcription models - the same they all use the top ABC. So they don't actually build their own transcription models. They use Assembly or they use Deepgram, or these other research rooms that basically do transcription for a living. These guys plug into that. They don't make their own model. It's just OpenAI or it's just Gemini or it's Claude. They just orchestrate it and put a fancy front end on.

**00:02:55 Speaker 5**  
Oh, okay.

**00:02:56 Speaker 1**  
Makes sense. So they're just a fancy front end that actually plugs in. It's like a cake. They don't make the flour or the eggs or the whatever. They're just the ones that pull it all together.

**00:03:06 Speaker 4**  
The thing that I'm interested in is the accuracy of the transcript, the security, and the cost.

**00:03:12 Speaker 3**  
That's what I was going to say. We actually trialed multiple over the last year or so. And I actually did an interesting experiment where we were interviewing staff and we ran transcripts next door to one another. And it was interesting because one of them actually even confused the person speaking. So the transcript, and when you got the AI readout of it, just had no weight in it whatsoever. That's the problem with the Teams one.

**00:03:40 Speaker 1**  
That's right. Teams is - that's right. You'd think that Microsoft would get this nailed, right? It's one of the worst. It is. It really is one of the worst.

**00:03:49 Speaker 3**  
Fireflies actually does seem to be the best. It seems to be the one you've settled on.

**00:03:53 Speaker 1**  
It is, personally. Okay, that's good to know. But if you think about it from a cost perspective, you go 30 staff at 30 bucks each or something. It's actually quite a lot of money.

**00:04:02 Speaker 4**  
$500 a year.

**00:04:03 Speaker 1**  
Per year, per person, right? So yeah, it does add up, I guess.

**00:04:09 Speaker 3**  
As the accountant in the room, it adds up.

**00:04:12 Speaker 5**  
The thing for me, because I've been using it in the context of going to a client for a day and interviewing - having eight sessions.

**00:04:27 Speaker 1**  
In a row.

**00:04:27 Speaker 5**  
In a row. And I can just basically press record. But I can also do it online. And that's where I find it's - like everything else that I tried using, it was a real ball trying to do it in person, whereas if you do it - and it seems to be able to pick up the different speakers and actors. And as long as what I did, which I found really helpful, was I'd go into a room and I'd say "I'm trialing this, I don't know how good it's going to be. Let's all introduce ourselves." And when you do that, then it very quickly allocates the different speakers, gives them the right name, summarizes what they said, and all that sort of thing.

**00:05:16 Speaker 1**  
Great.

**00:05:17 Speaker 5**  
I haven't tried Teams, but I haven't tried...

**00:05:21 Speaker 1**  
I think Teams tries to do that. I think meeting rooms are the hardest scenario to get AI to get it right, because it's called diarization - is what that technology is called. It's where AI tries to take a single audio source and diarize who's speaking. And they're either trying to do it by the voice, or just naturally in the language of people talking, they can pick up the fact that I talk this way, or I say these words, or I'm stopping and you're asking a question and I'm responding. They can - more just by the language - associate with a high degree of accuracy. Usually not 100% accuracy, but pretty good, who's speaking.

So anyways, long story short, I use Plaud often on my watch or I just put it on the table. That goes to an app on my phone, and I can also transcribe that way.

**00:06:08 Speaker 4**  
But for the business, you've elected Fireflies.

**00:06:10 Speaker 1**  
Yes, for the business, for our teams. That was really my question. That was a long-winded chat.

**00:06:14 Speaker 4**  
Because I don't want to trial 10 different things.

**00:06:17 Speaker 1**  
No.

**00:06:18 Speaker 4**  
The fact that you've done it.

**00:06:19 Speaker 1**  
We've done it.

**00:06:20 Speaker 3**  
Yeah, I would say we actually tried, what, four, five?

**00:06:23 Speaker 1**  
I think I've done five.

**00:06:24 Speaker 3**  
I think we've tried since in the last 15 months, basically. So you can pretty much guarantee in the last 15 months, what came out 15 months ago, we've tried it, know what's worked, and we're now on that next stage.

**00:06:37 Speaker 1**  
When I build my own, I'll let you know. Because the reason I say that is I saw a trend. Actually, someone in financial services has built their own as a SaaS platform. But the difference is that because they're a financial services company, when the Fireflies transcript comes out, it's a little bit nuanced that business. It's not generic. It's like "by the way, your client said this and here's the advice you should give them" - for that industry. So that's where you almost could take Fireflies from the level - in context of this chat we could actually build what we could either build or imagine: a tailored Fireflies.

Just imagine what that could look like if in Kui - it was similar cost or slightly more because it's better. But when you're having a legal meeting, it's got a legal flavor to it for your business. And it can even tap into the knowledge base we might build one day and all the other things. You start thinking "holy moly, we can have our transcript on steroids." Have a meeting and it builds a proposal for you an hour later because it's already got the orchestration part sorted. All that kind of stuff could potentially - use Fireflies for now in short.

But if you're going to buy a one-year plan, then you've got a one-year roadmap potentially to replace it or go month-to-month if you think it's going to be faster than that.

**00:07:53 Speaker 3**  
So can I just - sorry - just to bring us back on to focus.

**00:07:56 Speaker 1**  
That's it. I was done.

**00:07:59 Speaker 3**  
Have you invited specific people to the first stage? That's what I wanted to establish.

**00:08:03 Speaker 4**  
So what we'll do, we've got three stages. I'll do a quick round of intro. So online we have Christina, who is our project support team lead. She's joining us from Wellington. Roxy is also project support. And project support are the people who basically do and coordinate the invoicing. So they're invited for this section. Excellent. Matt and I, you know.

We've got Karen joining us for the proposal section and then Matt and me for that last section.

**00:08:43 Speaker 1**  
All right.

**00:08:44 Speaker 4**  
So Christina's been in the business for five years. I think she could do the invoicing process - the tricky bits, the easy bits - from beginning to end. So I'm pretty much going to direct you to Christina and Roxy for this first session.

**00:09:04 Speaker 1**  
Awesome.

**00:09:05 Speaker 3**  
No worries. I guess, just introducing myself because I haven't been here - accountant by trade, actually ex-KPMG originally, started out as an auditor, but I'm now their finance and commercial manager. But I've just spent the last 15 months basically being their test pilot, crash test dummy, whatever you want to call it. Which has now allowed me to make my team way more efficient, redirect our resources, and also redirect some of my resource, which has then allowed us to tap into my background, which is obviously audit business process, that sort of thing. Which is actually a really good skill set to line up with what we want to do in this sort of thing.

Where I want to - my first number one question for you guys to help us direct this conversation is, in terms of the invoicing - at the end, are we - so at the moment, my understanding is all your consultants basically do their own invoicing, per se. Is that correct?

**00:10:13 Speaker 1**  
And that may be where we start, because I wasn't 100% sure what the current status was.

**00:10:18 Speaker 3**  
Yeah, so what's the current status and where do you want to get to is really what I want to understand before we drive the conversation.

**00:10:27 Speaker 4**  
And I'll hand that over to Christina. But before I do, the one thing - this piece of the project, so we've got three key things here. This is our smallest piece. And the reason we're doing it is because it's a quick win that will hopefully get us a little bit of buy-in. It's not going to save us fortunes - a couple of hours of consultant time once a month. It's not one of those big things. So we definitely don't want to overcook it. But it's one of those things that will just get some buy-in and start getting people using AI across the board.

**00:11:01 Speaker 6**  
It's a complete warning.

**00:11:04 Speaker 1**  
All your consultants have to do the work for reading and they don't want to.

**00:11:09 Speaker 4**  
No, they do want to. There's one component. So I just wanted to put it in perspective because this is our short one.

**00:11:16 Speaker 1**  
So in Matt's words, it's a ball ache. He wants to get rid of the ball ache basically.

**00:11:23 Speaker 4**  
And then I'm going to hand over to Christina.

**00:11:25 Speaker 1**  
Awesome.

**00:11:26 Speaker 7**  
I was just going to say it's a very, very manual process. At the moment it's a Word template. We use ProjectWorks as our project management software, and it doesn't have a great approval flow really. It's not like you have some packages - you can create an invoice and then it'll trigger off an email to somebody else who will then be able to approve it. It doesn't really do that. It's quite manual in itself.

And also I think the consultants, or the way it's been done is that they have just their invoicing on a template and a separate little table for each job. And it also provides a few different areas where it tells them the budget, it tells them how much has been invoiced to date and how much time has been invoiced to date - not like expenses and stuff. And it also shows them the previous month's invoices, the notes that they've put on their invoices. And then they then go and look at the job, look at what their timesheet entries have been - which are usually pretty bad to be fair because the project manager itself knows what the notes are that nobody else can really understand them.

And then they use together their own notes to go on the actual invoice to be sent to the customer, which then has to go through an approval process. So it's very manual. And it's very manual for us to update, for the consultant to update. And I just think there's got to be a better way to go about that.

**00:13:00 Speaker 4**  
The consultants are working. They enter a timesheet note.

**00:13:04 Speaker 3**  
Into ProjectWorks.

**00:13:06 Speaker 4**  
Christina - so you're just - back to the beginning, you're actually extracting those notes from ProjectWorks, putting them in the Word document?

**00:13:17 Speaker 7**  
No. Where are the notes coming from? The first thing they'll do is if we provide them with it, they'll go onto their invoicing template, they'll choose a job, they will look at their invoicing notes and weave it together into what they want it to say to the customer, manually type it in. Then we manually copy that into ProjectWorks. But we also say the previous month that they have put in, so that they know they're not...

**00:13:44 Speaker 3**  
So you're doing construction progress billing, basically. So you're doing progress billing.

**00:13:50 Speaker 5**  
Well, yes, but...

**00:13:53 Speaker 3**  
Oh no, we bill from the time we work. Yeah, but over a period of time per month. So the client might want to actually track where you're at, or is it just month by month? It's isolated.

**00:14:06 Speaker 5**  
It's more that our invoices are bespoke to what we've done for the month. And we need to - the notes have to be sufficiently detailed to justify what the amount is that we're invoicing. So we can't just send an invoice to a client for $15,000 worth of stuff we did this month.

**00:14:26 Speaker 3**  
And it's not that they want to actually track it. They just want the knowledge of what you've actually done.

**00:14:31 Speaker 5**  
Because a lot of our jobs are - most of our jobs are project-based, so they have a - it's like we're delivering something. And it might be, let's say it's a business case, it might be anywhere between $30,000 to $70,000 or thereabouts - sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller. And you've got - the first month we might bill them $10,000 or $15,000, but we haven't actually delivered the business case yet, so we have to justify what we've done.

**00:15:02 Speaker 3**  
That's what I was trying to get to, because obviously I was trying to work out if you're full construction type progress billing, so you need that knowledge to carry forward. Because what I'm already hearing is there's no reason why, and that ProjectWorks - when the engineers - the consultants, sorry - actually do their original timesheets, right? Do they put in pretty good details in those notes?

**00:15:27 Speaker 1**  
Well, very, very variable, right? Because that... And match the consultant together.

**00:15:32 Speaker 3**  
So...

**00:15:33 Speaker 1**  
He's one of the stakeholders in this. As a consultant, the one doing the work.

**00:15:36 Speaker 3**  
So essentially, though, that note could form the whole basis of the event you're working on.

**00:15:45 Speaker 7**  
I think if people knew that it could automatically reform that way, then they would put much more detailed notes in. But at the moment, because they know they're the ones who are going to have to weave it anyway, it doesn't require it to be quite as detailed.

**00:16:02 Speaker 5**  
Christina, would it be fair to say that, in my experience, if I'm the project manager on a job - because there will only be one project manager on each job, but there might be multiple consultants - I'm more likely to put more detailed, hourly or time-based notes in my timesheet over the month because I know that I'll have to use those to write a...

**00:16:27 Speaker 3**  
So when you're doing your invoicing, you're actually as the manager - you might have multiple consultants working on that some projects. So the one invoice is basically a combination of all of those.

**00:16:40 Speaker 1**  
So that's really easy to automate. Well, as you're saying, the consultants do average notes, but the project managers do it because the cannibal falls on what's on the invoice. So they would be the one - it's a bit of an assumption, so it's in their best interest to do good notes. But the consultants are just not doing great notes because timesheeting is - so they always do "I did eight hours" and then there was nothing.

**00:17:02 Speaker 5**  
I mean everyone has to put in what they did, but it's quite minimum.

**00:17:09 Speaker 7**  
The full stop. Right. I managed to stop them from just putting a full stop as well.

**00:17:14 Speaker 1**  
Oh, is that right? But then the project manager - so you would be kind of aware of what's going on, so you almost times you on behalf of consultants, is that what you're saying? Well, when you get to the invoice, you have to fill in the gaps.

**00:17:24 Speaker 3**  
And he's pulling it all together, right? So the end result is basically pulling all the info from the other people together.

**00:17:31 Speaker 1**  
Makes sense.

**00:17:31 Speaker 3**  
So there's no reason why we couldn't automate all the feeds and make it into one transcript, which then becomes the basis for their billing.

**00:17:41 Speaker 5**  
You're basically having to triangulate between what you did last month, right, as a sort of reminder of what we've already billed for. The WIP, which is the list of the timesheet that's got a consolidation of all of the time that was booked on that project for the month and the notes, and the scope of what you are supposed to be doing for the client, and what are the more macro tasks that you know that you have done during...

**00:18:22 Speaker 3**  
The AI could even actually identify what is left to do.

**00:18:27 Speaker 1**  
I was just going to say...

**00:18:28 Speaker 3**  
So it could actually make it even smarter.

**00:18:30 Speaker 1**  
Think about an AI which can read the statement of work and then can read the notes and find the gaps and help the project manager make great notes for their invoice against what's being done, but also help you to correlate against statement of work. So therefore, your statement of work needs to be really, really good - either customer-facing or internal versions of that. Because if you're building a statement of work that's not just for humans, but for AIs - think about that. We should actually go through a process as well. So the statement of works is done by the consultant, the project manager?

**00:19:07 Speaker 5**  
It varies depending on how your client is, but it's generally we've got a pretty detailed proposal which we then would translate into a contract.

**00:19:19 Speaker 1**  
Okay. All right, this is the - so this is an invoice template, is it? And it's multi-page. Is that because there's multiple pages with what they've just described?

**00:19:31 Speaker 3**  
Date.

**00:19:38 Speaker 7**  
These are all the tables for each particular job. The notes in blue are from the previous month. This is the current - this is the invoice that has just been - the notes have been done. And in the bottom we've got how much they forecast, the total budget, how much has been invoiced to date under the PDS. And you're putting on that sheet manually from ProjectWorks? Yes. Every one here is manual? Yeah.

**00:20:05 Speaker 5**  
And we're also putting in the time up the top, right?

**00:20:10 Speaker 3**  
We could also work that out from the timesheets. I can read that through.

**00:20:15 Speaker 5**  
We fill that out and the disbursements as well.

**00:20:19 Speaker 3**  
Yeah, I've never used ProjectWorks.

**00:20:22 Speaker 1**  
There's an API. So one question I have is do you care if it's a Word template in the end of the day, or do you want - because an alternative could be that we essentially build a minor little front-end which ingests, reads and writes data to ProjectWorks, or reads data from ProjectWorks, and formats it in the same way you currently have it.

**00:20:45 Speaker 2**  
Okay, nice. But I have tried playing around with SQL queries to get stuff into Excel. And then from Excel I do a mail merge into the Word document. There's a couple of things that don't work. So I found other ways of doing it. But I don't think - I think if we could get it into an Excel or something, we can then extract that and put it into whatever format we want. But it's about getting that information off of ProjectWorks and having it then automatically populated in the web document.

**00:21:28 Speaker 7**  
We're not trying to do power queries and things, but it's quite - like there is actually on the website of ProjectWorks, they do have a list of all these schemas, all these different bits. But I've found it quite difficult to get the amount of time that's been invoiced, not just the total net of GST invoiced, because we want to know the time, not the disbursements and everything else. It's just putting all those bits together, and they're all quite separate and different. And then it becomes such a big table, the detail goes too big for me.

**00:22:06 Speaker 4**  
While you're doing show and tell, can you also show the invoicing spreadsheet? Because I think that should be part of the solution. Yeah, that would be tracking your money side of things, correct?

**00:22:17 Speaker 5**  
Before you do that though, maybe while we're on this, can you start with the WIP - those PDFs that show the WIP?

**00:22:28 Speaker 1**  
Interesting. So you've got PDFs.

**00:22:31 Speaker 5**  
Which must be an extraction out of ProjectWorks, right?

**00:22:35 Speaker 3**  
I think the WIP you can get as a CSV. I was going to say, I bet you can download it as a CSV if you can do it as a PDF.

**00:22:43 Speaker 5**  
But if you just show a project-based one, you'll see what the data looks like.

**00:22:50 Speaker 4**  
Hang on a second. Let me find one. I think the show and tell is important.

**00:22:57 Speaker 1**  
It is really important. Because we essentially have to figure out what we call an "as-is" process - what's the today. And then when we design what it will be, there's obviously numerous variables and a number of ways to do the same thing. We need to understand what will not change. So you're not going to change putting data into ProjectWorks. You're not going to change ABC. But what will change is the part in the middle.

The end result is an invoice to the customer that looks like ABC in this format. How do we get it from there to there? It's faster. And very likely, it'll need some sort of API, some sort of data transformation. But we don't have to use Word. We can print it to HTML, which then go to a PDF that looks the same as your Word template. And all the data can be ingested from previous months and current months. And whatever we can get out of the ProjectWorks, we can actually build an algorithm to do it all. It's just about that rulebook, the ingredients list, if that makes sense. And as long as the data's there, I think we can build it.

**00:23:59 Speaker 7**  
And we'll need to go back to the...

**00:24:01 Speaker 1**  
If that makes sense.

**00:24:02 Speaker 7**  
So we can raise the invoice. Is that Word or is that Excel? This is what we provide to the consultant. It's an invoice breakdown report. So this has got their comments, which will be their timesheet notes.

**00:24:14 Speaker 5**  
Well, we summarize those, though, right? We don't...

**00:24:19 Speaker 3**  
Where have you prepared that document before you PDF'd it? It's on ProjectWorks. So that has come from ProjectWorks?

**00:24:29 Speaker 7**  
Yeah, if you go onto ProjectWorks...

**00:24:36 Speaker 3**  
He's got it in Word for us. So there's all sorts of info in there. It's about extracting it correctly.

**00:24:41 Speaker 1**  
I've got the API here. So I can pull out timesheets, jobs, reports.

**00:24:47 Speaker 2**  
I tried fiddling with the API, but what I couldn't do was - it didn't have data that matched, so you couldn't link the reports to the forecasts or the invoices to the expenses. So the data that was coming out, I couldn't work with. Okay. Which is why I looked at the...

**00:25:06 Speaker 7**  
So what we would do is this has already got wording in it because it's been provided to me. But normally it would just say "professional services." And through here, this is where you choose whether you're going to - this is the breakdown that we provide, which they will then in that template put in their words that they want, which really then copy and paste back into here.

**00:25:26 Speaker 5**  
But I guess what we do - what the manual part of it for us as consultants is that we don't just copy and paste all of those notes because, you know, a lot of it's kind of either stuff we don't want to be telling the client or it doesn't make sense in the context of what we've been asked to do. So it's kind of like taking - for argument's sake, there might have been 30 different hourly inputs in there, separate inputs. It's taken in and go summarize that for me in five bullet points, right? That's the part that we have to do. Yeah, we need a language model that does that for us, to make it more efficient, because that's the thing that you go "oh my god, it's the first of the month and now I've got to go through all of these things and summarize all this stuff."

**00:26:18 Speaker 3**  
It's a really good statement of works, right? And we train the model to basically compare, to bring in all of their notes and compare what's actually done. The model would almost do half of the work for them, right?

**00:26:33 Speaker 1**  
In terms of - so are we talking - we're obviously talking about multiple things here, but you're talking about the actual timesheeting function as well. So for you as a consultant, obviously there's many parts to this process. One is the invoice creation, which is an output, but an input is the actual consultant's notes. So are you typically doing, or is everyone doing notes once a month in timesheets?

**00:26:56 Speaker 5**  
No, no, we do it daily.

**00:26:57 Speaker 1**  
You do notes daily? Yes. Okay, you're doing your notes and you're doing timesheets into ProjectWorks daily? Or every other day.

**00:27:05 Speaker 5**  
Three times a week, or once a month, weekly, depending.

**00:27:07 Speaker 1**  
But you're inputting those notes into ProjectWorks as timesheets. Yeah. And then - so then, just to clarify, at the end of the month, there's a process where you essentially reformat all that so it's customer-friendly, is that summarizing?

**00:27:23 Speaker 5**  
Basically. Yes, we transform it.

**00:27:25 Speaker 1**  
You transform it. So you might have done, call it, 30 things in a month, and that's 100 hours.

**00:27:34 Speaker 5**  
To five main things.

**00:27:36 Speaker 1**  
And there could be lots of notes, scratch notes, and it could be kind of not there.

**00:27:41 Speaker 5**  
We very much don't want to be giving our clients the breakdown.

**00:27:45 Speaker 1**  
And is that why you don't bill? It's similar to what we want to do from the end times. So you don't bill out of ProjectWorks, or you create an invoice in ProjectWorks, but you don't send the invoice out of ProjectWorks? No. Okay, so what we do...

**00:27:54 Speaker 3**  
It's the same concept. Hold on, stop. We do? It does, but only after you've made it look exactly how you want the client to see, right? So it's the same concept that we're...

**00:28:07 Speaker 5**  
So what's the Word document for? That's for... The Word document is to capture the consultant's - it's pulling things together. Yeah, basically, narrative around what was done, the amount that they want to bill, because we don't always bill the exact amount that we've charged up to the job. So we need to be able to have a manual override to say "no, I'm not charging 10 grand, I'm charging 8 grand, because that 2 grand was - I don't know - we'll charge it later because it's work that we're going to charge as part of another phase, or we're going to write it off," or I don't know. Do you know what I mean? We have to have that manual override.

And we also don't provide that breakdown of like "we did this many hours."

**00:28:48 Speaker 1**  
I see. So your ProjectWorks invoice is more - I call it a simple - a summary. And then now - and you have a Word document like a supplementary Word document, so they're both - the numbers will match dollar for dollar, but the Word document is multi-page, lots of notes. Is that kind of what it is?

No, no. The Word document is what we use to bring it all together, right? So it's basically the central brain where they're putting in the time, they're putting in the work that's done, they're putting in what's outstanding, they're putting in what they did last month.

**00:29:16 Speaker 3**  
And then they're putting that all into one document so the end user can see it. So the Word is the customer. That's then approved, and you guys then fine-tune it, right?

**00:29:41 Speaker 2**  
The consultant uses the Word document as well as the invoice breakdown to come up with the five bullet points that go onto the invoice.

**00:29:51 Speaker 1**  
But the customer will never see the Word document.

**00:29:53 Speaker 3**  
No, but it's the hub of bringing all the info together, right?

**00:29:58 Speaker 5**  
It's our means to summarize and tell the story about why we're charging them $10,000.

**00:30:05 Speaker 1**  
And so just to reinvent the whole process, potentially, if we removed the Word document today, what would break? Is there another way of doing it that you think could be possible?

**00:30:15 Speaker 7**  
People would have to actually manually go into ProjectWorks and everybody would have to write it themselves what they want to do.

**00:30:22 Speaker 1**  
Are they doing that anyway? Putting time in? Maybe I'm missing something.

**00:30:26 Speaker 5**  
Well the difference is that, so my time today, right, I will do a job and I will do like an hour on a model and I'll say - I'll just put "cost model review," right? And then tomorrow I might be report writing on the same job and I'll go "drafting report" and all that sort of stuff. But then when I come to the end of the month, I don't say when I invoice, I say "drafting of report for blah, blah, blah," for a material recycling facility RFP. And then I'll say cost modeling - cost modeling and cost modeling review for the same job. I've got to put more - I've got to put the flesh around the bones about what it actually is that we're doing for the client.

**00:31:27 Speaker 3**  
Is that info - the flesh around the bones - am I correct that info is already on the statement of works primarily? It should be, yes, right? So essentially what - like if you think about like what our boys do, right, when they do like a firewall, there's about five steps that go to a firewall. I'm really simplifying it, right? What these guys are trying to do here is break that five steps down into two, so the client only sees two steps, but they've actually commented all five. They want to summarize the five into the two that lines up with the statement of works, because that's what the client's expecting to see on the invoice.

**00:32:05 Speaker 1**  
The only thing I'm missing, and I'm so sorry...

**00:32:09 Speaker 7**  
With the table we provide, or the multiple - every person gets their own Word document that has all their projects. Because people can be on like 10 or 12 projects at a time.

**00:32:20 Speaker 3**  
So they might have 12 of these.

**00:32:23 Speaker 7**  
So we kind of consolidate the information so they see the budget, they see what the forecast is, they see what they've already invoiced all in one spot. So they don't have to - because in ProjectWorks it's on different tabs. It's like bringing it all together into the Word.

**00:32:39 Speaker 1**  
So what I'm trying to understand - I think I understand. So your Word document is essentially a workaround. Yeah. That's what - if I was to summarize it right back, you use it because ProjectWorks isn't... Too slow or something. It's a mechanism to - it's a mechanism to help a consultant managers, but the reason I say this is if we develop a new system or what it looks like - we're essentially going to replace their Word document system altogether, right? And I really want to understand the purpose of that so that we can do it in the most efficient way.

So as an example, what I'm thinking is what if we had an interface which did all that for you and brought all the projects - for like - just that. So that you as a consultant - we can sit down with you and you say "what's the thing?" If you had an application which is essentially - like we've done this ourselves. And our own - so we've a system called ConnectWise. It's the world's biggest IT management platform. But it's the world's crappiest piece of software. It's not crappy - what I mean, it's designed to be a very big engine, a great engine. It does a lot, but the person who had made it did not think about the user.

Like we have to go in and out of like 100 tabs to find one piece of information. So we've essentially built - like we've built and building - little workarounds as well. So I've got a system where when my guys drive their car, it's GPS tracked, and then I built a little dashboard that tells them they drive from this location to that location, "which ticket did you drive on?" They can click it and click timesheet, done. The whole thing abstracts away from having to go into a job and remember that I drove at 9 a.m. to 10. All that - they just look at a single sheet and they see that I can drive from these places, ticket one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, go, done.

And that's the same idea - abstract away from the really clunky UI. We need the clunky UI because that's ultimately the engine which we log the time on and generally invoices on, if I'm understanding this. Now - yeah. So the Word document essentially is an internal tool, not client-facing. It's an internal tool to help a consultant be more efficient, track, summarize the work. And then the information that's seen on there is useful - previous jobs, shoot choose on whatever, whatever.

So if we were to build an interface, we would want to basically replicate the Word document information so everything is there, but ultimately if we can pull it from the API, we could essentially fetch everything in real time so that I can - so when I really hone it on a design that makes good sense for you guys. And you could essentially, I imagine, never go into ProjectWorks. You would just have your own timesheet, or maybe we could even add a button for voice notes. And you say "I do this, this," boom - it translates in front of you, writes a beautiful note, and then you click save, done. Something like that.

**00:35:41 Speaker 3**  
This can actually then feed into the next thing on their list, which is the proposal writer. The interface could use that as well.

**00:35:49 Speaker 5**  
Potentially. I guess from an invoice perspective, the main thing to understand is that that's really important to us, is that I don't see a situation where we can ever be - where we ever really want to be fully automated because we want to have that control over like "hey, we're kind of getting into a world of value invoicing. Yeah. We don't - we're not wanting to say "now it was just 15 and a half hours this month." We did this thing which is worth this much. And it's worth this much. And so we need to have that - it's kind of like if AI can get us 80% there in terms of the narrative about what we did, it's great. And then we can just go, whether we type or talk or whatever, it's irrelevant.

**00:36:37 Speaker 1**  
Yeah, of course. It's just important. I think that's awesome.

**00:36:40 Speaker 3**  
We've been having the same conflict within our company, right? Because these boys who are so AI-focused want to basically automate all the information from our boys, our engineers, and give it to the clients. Now, me and the directors are like "there ain't no way this is ever going to happen while I work for this company." Like, literally, I've thrown my toys out of the cot over it. Have I not? Yes, I have. I've literally thrown... And so there's no way. So we're challenged with the same thing. I know they can do it, but I also know if you give that information to my client, I'm going to have so many collection problems, it's going to drive me nuts.

So the point is, what I've done with them is I always insist that everything they build, a human has to check it before it's sent. So we can automate all the inputs.

**00:37:30 Speaker 3**  
Even this input, into this dashboard that I think we could build that will solve both of your problems. No matter what, if you're using Xero, so like what we do, is it goes from all of that, then it goes to Xero. Nothing leaves Xero without me looking at it first, and that's my check.

**00:37:52 Speaker 2**  
In terms of, I'm just thinking about the - so the consultants do need to see the timesheet notes. Yes, but the client doesn't. Yes, the client doesn't. I was wondering whether there could be a way to make it easier for the consultants to put those timesheet entries into AI, so that there's a suggested invoice description. Yep. And then they just review it. Consultant can just check it and if changes need to be made.

**00:38:19 Speaker 1**  
What I would actually be doing is not even needing you to go into AI. I would have that built into the platform. So imagine if you're seeing an interface, and you click job, new time entry, and you start typing. You click a button and right in front of you, it should just be - it could either reformat it into bullet points. You could even have it check against the SOW. And you can imagine, whatever you can sort of imagine being a beautiful, simple, but effective experience, I think we could build that.

Because what I can see in the API just really briefly is we can pull timesheets from the system, which means we can likely pull last month's. We could display that on the screen. You could have an input box where you're typing. You could have a button which is like a little magic wand that you click on it and it's trained on your notes and formats them in a nice bullet point. You could even have a recommender like "hey, I can notice that you did this last month and this month." All these little things become - make up the - what we call a PRD, a product requirements document.

So we would really explore what are the most important things to you. And I would be wanting to look at a document like the Word document you've got. This has been excellent understanding. I found this on the web. Thank you. Sarah, you found from the web, that's great. When AI talks back to you, that's the weird thing. Imagine if the day Fireflies pipes up and says "hey guys, you got it all wrong - here's how I should be doing." That would be a weird day, but I'm sure we'll have them one day.

Hey, understanding your requirements is the main thing. And there's always multiple stakeholders as well. So as a consultant, what you see is maybe you - maybe you're seeing reporting. Maybe you guys want to see something as well. So we gather all the requirements and we start to pull together what's called a PRD. This will be what we start to build, I think, after today's meeting. And also maybe need some additional meetings and stuff. But that's where I'm thinking now is that essentially we really want to go up to the North Star, which is how do we create efficiency for consultants and the team? How do we do that?

Well, we've got this current process, which is clunky and it works, but it's slow. It's great. Just make it faster.

**00:40:29 Speaker 5**  
The problem with the process at the moment, as I see it from my perspective, is that it interrupts your flow because every month you have to just down tools and do this thing because we can't - as a business, we want to know how have we done this month? You need to make money. So we have, every business - you can't do it in your own time. You have to do it in everyone else's. We have to get everyone to do it. And so that we know by whatever date it is, like the 5th or the 6th or whatever - "hey, these are all the invoices that are going out for the month. And this is how much money we're going to make and blah, blah, blah."

And so that's what's - and if you've got 10 invoices or 15 invoices that you've got to generate, that's a real hassle. Especially if they're not simple. If they're - you have to do - you go "oh, we can't bill them that much because we haven't - we actually..."

**00:41:32 Speaker 3**  
And that's why there's got to be that human underwrite on the dashboard.

**00:41:36 Speaker 1**  
But I can imagine some kind of workflow. And again, this is really Sunday night's camp here when it comes to the actual building. I can imagine - I want to tease out a workflow. But I can imagine a consultant's view - log in and you see all the work which has been logged. And let's say you're the responsible - you can either have some kind of wizard experience where you click and you go through a next process. And that's like generated the invoice. And there's AI in there. Maybe it's like click - see all the invoices, click a button, it summarizes everything into five categories. You say "make it longer," click - it writes it longer. That it, it up - you can kind of imagine that kind of experience.

Looks great. Next. Double check the invoices. Approved. Next. And that just shows the next one. So maybe you're in - in one hour or half an hour - and you just kind of one by one by one that you are - you are super focused on it. There's automations to help collate the notes and give you all the information you need to do your job, a.k.a. creates invoice, but you just make it really easy in the interface. You might see some kind of a - I'm just imagining what the experience could look like and just summarizing.

**00:42:37 Speaker 5**  
Summarizing what you've done, that's right. So in the language that makes - these guys are going to give the stuff. Like that's just kind of help. And they're almost like manual prompts for us to do that exercise.

**00:42:53 Speaker 4**  
And then does that take you guys ages, right, doesn't it? I can imagine a hundred projects that she's different. And for each, you know, you get different information on different tabs. So for each project, you've got to go to the invoices and then you've got to go to the forecast to update the - yeah. Yeah, the word. So it's very manual.

**00:43:18 Speaker 7**  
I think if we just had one centralized thing - doesn't matter what it's made of - that just pulls in all the information that they need in one place, provides what they were on the invoice last month by the writing, summarizes this week, this month. Or even like there's a tip - like it shows you the actual breakdown and you just tick which ones you want to do.

**00:43:42 Speaker 1**  
That's right, yes, that kind of thing.

**00:43:45 Speaker 5**  
Christina, why do we need to know what happened - what we invoiced last month? Because that was just what I wanted to ask you. Because I only use that as a prompt for what we're going to write about this month. Like it's not - we don't send it again and say "this is what we did for you last month."

**00:44:04 Speaker 1**  
It's more context for you when you're trying to...

**00:44:06 Speaker 7**  
The reason for it is so that you don't repeat what happened in the customer campaign when you've already charged us for that.

**00:44:11 Speaker 1**  
That makes sense. Okay, so it's making - I think I'm getting a clear picture now. The one thing I think it would be great to dig into a little bit more, and I realize we're almost at 10, would be if there are other stakeholder requirements here. As in like, let's say there's kind of two approaches here, right? We got - let's focus on an application for the consultant. So the consultant's view is clearly that maybe - pull up the main experience here or the main stakeholder here. And we could have some sort of a job list, and then we pull data from ProjectWorks, and if you're tagged to it or whatever, we can do all that sort of stuff.

The same, replicating the same experience logging into ProjectWorks, just abstracting in a way. But let's say, is there other stakeholders? Maybe is there another - would you like a view? Would you like a view? Would you like a view? Where you're logging in, you're maybe seeing everybody's report view. You know what I mean? Daily whip thing, like there's a magic...

**00:45:08 Speaker 7**  
It's a kind of little approval process.

**00:45:10 Speaker 1**  
An approval process. It's like - fantastic. So maybe there's like a button where you as a consultant, you get to a certain period and you've approved, but it doesn't do anything other than it sends a - in the database and now it's flagged it for someone else when they log in. They now see the list of things to approve. And then they're going to need data as well. They might want last month's invoice versus this month's and they might want ABC. And they might want ability to push it back to consultants or they might want to write. Yeah. So it's almost like when we start thinking about custom software or custom applications or whatever, we do need to think through those different stakeholders or we call them different users or different user stories. So if I'm a consultant, I want to see blah. If I'm an accountant, I want to see da. If I'm a director... Like an EPIC. Yeah, like an EPIC. That's right.

**00:46:08 Speaker 3**  
Is there any different flows into it other than from workflows?

**00:46:12 Speaker 1**  
Other than timesheets.

**00:46:13 Speaker 3**  
Other than workflows, or is that the only input so that we don't - there's not anything else coming in that maybe is not coming? Expenses.

**00:46:23 Speaker 4**  
So there's the timesheets and then there's disbursements. Which is just - we just - it's in ProjectWorks.

**00:46:29 Speaker 3**  
But it still goes on to the bottom of the invoice, right? Yes, correct. Okay.

**00:46:34 Speaker 5**  
And then there's that overlay of our transformation of - so for example, I might, and I do this quite regularly, I'll say "well, I'm only going to charge them this much this month because I'm going to manage that extra - that additional amount - because I'm going to put that into the next phase or something."

**00:47:00 Speaker 1**  
But that would be at a timesheet by timesheet individual level so that idea...

**00:47:05 Speaker 3**  
You should be able to do that pretty well. So, you know how we do with Goldsworthy, right? How we've created that price calculator with Goldsworthy where you basically can go in and change it? There's no reason why the same concept wouldn't work for this.

**00:47:19 Speaker 1**  
When I was just meaning by the timesheet, I wasn't sure if this was how you mean. But if let's say you did 20 timesheets and you could have the ability to untick five of them? What would you be splitting an individual timesheet potentially as well in half that kind? Or is it just a dollar value?

**00:47:34 Speaker 5**  
It's more intuitive than just - yeah, the timesheets. It really - if you from our perspective as a consultant is more to give you - I mean you obviously have to bill it all if you can. But it's not that you...

**00:47:49 Speaker 3**  
It's not like us, where every 30 minutes I want to find somebody to bill for it. It's not like that. It's a different type of concept. They more want to be able to override. So let's say the timesheet comes through and says "bill $10,000" and he's saying "oh, I really only want to do eight." They just want to be able to override that to eight, right?

**00:48:10 Speaker 7**  
Can I just interject though, that while the consultant can say "yes, just bill eight," Roxy and I...

**00:48:20 Speaker 1**  
So there's more than one user, right? On the timesheet.

**00:48:26 Speaker 7**  
So it is line by line for us.

**00:48:28 Speaker 3**  
And that's fair enough because you sit where I sit, which is wanting to make sure you get the maximum money for that month because you've got to pay the bills on the 20th.

**00:48:36 Speaker 4**  
But also ProjectWorks - if we just round it up and do a manual entry, it won't carry forward that two grand. We actually go and uncheck the timesheets.

**00:48:46 Speaker 3**  
So we're going to have to track that basically through it.

**00:48:49 Speaker 4**  
We uncheck the timesheets and try and get the very closest we can to that amount because, you know, if Matt says "Bill 8" and the timesheets come up to $8,002, you've got to really do some wiggling to get it to that amount. So it's not just a simple override.

**00:49:11 Speaker 7**  
If AI could figure out the timesheets to get to the closest...

**00:49:19 Speaker 4**  
I think you can manually do it. That might not, but yeah it is. I think we probably could though. Probably. Who knows?

**00:49:28 Speaker 3**  
And then you would carry the other timesheets over to the next month so they don't get lost essentially. Correct. Whether we did it that way or another way, I reckon somebody would be able to find the things.

**00:49:37 Speaker 4**  
Yeah, I mean that would be helpful. It's not just a "oh I'm going to charge eight and bring two forward."

**00:49:42 Speaker 5**  
Yeah, I get it, because you don't want to lose it. But there's a bit of tension here obviously. I've got that. You know, internally, and Anna's the same, she'll be like "oh you haven't billed this." She's our finance manager. And it's like, well, but we can't have a whole bunch of people just writing down "oh I did five hours of this" and then just send it off to the client and they just happily pay. We get pushback all the time. It's got to translate.

**00:50:08 Speaker 4**  
There's not going to be a change and AI's not going to resolve that.

**00:50:10 Speaker 5**  
No, no, no. But AI can help us go, how can we easily manage that process, right? And make it as easy as possible.

**00:50:19 Speaker 3**  
It is similar, once again, to that same problem that we're trying to solve with giving our clients... Our sales guys want to give all the clients all the information. The finance team are like, no.

**00:50:30 Speaker 1**  
So we have that same conflict. Yeah, I understand. Yeah, there's a lot of interesting... This has been a great meeting. I know it's very much an introductory meeting. From here, I think... What's your thinking, Sunday? I know you've been sitting there quiet. I know you're a process... So Sunday's really an expert in very... She's a career automation specialist and business process mapper and also full-stack developer as well. So I've got one-two punch there with Sunday in terms of being able to map a process out. And she'll be the one that does process mapping, and then helps translate the technical requirements. And then we can, obviously, as a team, can build any application or automation or a mixture of that. But yeah, so I thought I'd ask you a question because you might be sitting there wondering some... stuff?

**00:51:17 Speaker 8**  
Actually, one thing I want to ask - I realize you have business in New Zealand and Australia too.

**00:51:26 Speaker 1**  
Oh yeah, that's a great question. Is this more complicated?

**00:51:31 Speaker 4**  
Are we just doing New Zealand? No, it's all in ProjectWorks. So both companies are in ProjectWorks. ProjectWorks does multi-currency. We have a project support person in each office. So Roxy's Auckland, Christina's Wellington, there's another person in Australia. The process is the same for all of them. So the process is the same, the software is the same. It's multi-currency in ProjectWorks.

**00:51:54 Speaker 1**  
And Xero or something? It's all in the same Xero? Or is it two different Xeros?

**00:51:59 Speaker 3**  
So it's actually a different company.

**00:52:04 Speaker 4**  
But the invoicing, once it's approved in ProjectWorks, Xero knows - ProjectWorks knows which Xero just approved.

**00:52:10 Speaker 1**  
Oh, it's because Xero - ProjectWorks supports multiple.

**00:52:17 Speaker 4**  
Yeah. Perfect.

**00:52:18 Speaker 4**  
So it's all one platform.

**00:52:20 Speaker 8**  
It's really just ProjectWorks itself. So New Zealand consulting - if you're in New Zealand consulting - if you're in New Zealand consulting, it's out in Australia, it knows into your Australia office?

**00:52:38 Speaker 4**  
Wherever the project manager is. So if it's a New Zealand job and it's got a New Zealand project manager, New Zealand will do the invoices. So it's based on the project manager.

**00:52:49 Speaker 3**  
Do you ever have people in multiple offices working on the same project? So you might have somebody in Aussie working on a project here in New Zealand?

**00:53:00 Speaker 4**  
That doesn't - it's the same. Same process. They do a timesheet on the job.

**00:53:06 Speaker 3**  
So you basically do the exact two processes parallel, one for the Aussie company, one for the New Zealand company.

**00:53:14 Speaker 4**  
It's all one. It's all one process.

**00:53:17 Speaker 3**  
But they get invoiced through different Xeros, but they are identical.

**00:53:21 Speaker 1**  
But it's out of the same ProjectWorks.

**00:53:23 Speaker 8**  
It's just synced different Xeros.

**00:53:28 Speaker 1**  
I'd imagine it's like us with ConnectWise, how we had two different Xeros - lower north - but it's just the same ProjectWorks, but it will support two different Xeros.

**00:53:37 Speaker 3**  
But it's the exact same process, exactly the same, all three offices.

**00:53:42 Speaker 7**  
The invoices are actually here, the ProjectWorks, and then exported to Xero, which is where the finance manager does what he or she needs to do with them. The invoices go from ProjectWorks themselves.

**00:54:08 Speaker 1**  
So have we covered off the crux of it, do you think?

**00:54:15 Speaker 5**  
Yeah, I think from our perspective, it's probably worthwhile. You might need to dive into the PD process a wee bit more, but I don't want to talk too much about it.

**00:54:30 Speaker 1**  
Is that project director?

**00:54:31 Speaker 5**  
Well, that's sort of at the end when we go "okay, we're happy with that invoice." You know, that project has the right amount, you know. It's on track. What I'd probably like to do at some point - and this could be split between us - like it's literally sit with you for half an hour, just watch your process. Sit with you for half an hour and just go through one by one, kind of one at once. And then even maybe PDF - there was it more than one PDF or is it just one? Yes, okay. So let's sit with them as well and just understand from everybody's perspective the different friction points or different pain points. And then we can kind of wash up at the end and say "all right, the platform we're going to build is ABC. It's going to solve these challenges for these different people, different roles." And that way we get a holistic picture because no one wants to get halfway through your project and realize we've missed some critical requirements and have to remake something.

**00:55:25 Speaker 5**  
Totally. And probably something that might help you is I'll tell you what I know that I've done a little bit of, but other consultants have done more - we've already started experimenting with taking those PDFs of all of that, you know, the time for the month, and dumping it into Copilot and saying "can you summarize?"

**00:55:47 Speaker 1**  
Perfect. That's great. So essentially it's taking all that learning, which is excellent. But as a developer, we can essentially bake that all into a process. Much easier. I've already summarized this. That's right. You know? 100%. But as a user, that's what I want, isn't it? Like "check this, check this. Oh, hang on, you missed the point there that I need to highlight." That's right. If you kind of take essentially - it's an orchestrated process, start to finish, through getting information out of ProjectWorks, AI-enhanced all along the way, without needing to copy and paste in - our systems just happen right in front of you in some sort of guided application. And if we can achieve that with a simple interface that works, that's really fast - I think that would be great.

Any other questions for you, Sandhya, or Roshan?

**00:56:39 Speaker 3**  
My next question I think is actually going to be answered in our next session because I'm now thinking of the input into it.

**00:56:45 Speaker 1**  
Should we quickly plan some potential next meetings? Like it would be great to have another meeting with you, just a little half-hour. Teams, so we can just organize some teams. Is it worth doing a session with both of you as well? Like another half hour we'd screen share, we go through individually or together?

**00:57:02 Speaker 2**  
I think with Christina because she's obviously got a lot more experience. Only five weeks in, so...

**00:57:09 Speaker 7**  
It's also good to get a new perspective as well coming in from the outside.

**00:57:14 Speaker 5**  
You definitely need their perspective and our perspective on this process. Definitely.

**00:57:20 Speaker 4**  
Well, of course. Project support has the bulk of it. You know, while we say we're saving consultants' time, so sorry to the consultants.

**00:57:29 Speaker 5**  
It's not all about the consultancy, but it is. It's like one day - it can be one day out of 20 billable days that you have to do - that you're writing off in terms of...

**00:57:43 Speaker 1**  
Wild, so that's actually not insignificant.

**00:57:45 Speaker 5**  
Across 20... Potentially, and I'm not saying it always...

**00:57:49 Speaker 1**  
Well, even if it was only half a day, that's still...

**00:57:51 Speaker 4**  
You could have tried to do an ROI calculation. I was actually already thinking...

**00:57:55 Speaker 3**  
I can see that. And earlier when we said it wasn't a big-time saver, I think the important thing is to keep it as simple as possible.

**00:58:03 Speaker 1**  
Even if it was four hours a month - like I said to people, it's 120 hours a month.

**00:58:07 Speaker 5**  
I'd say most people are invoicing - most consultants are spending about, probably on average, about four hours.

**00:58:15 Speaker 1**  
So let's call it 1,400 hours a year. You know, that's - again, it's a lot of time.

**00:58:21 Speaker 3**  
But not only that, it's time that you can actually take back and use as billable time if we can just summarize all of that. And it might be as simple as - I mean, to make it really work and make the AI as good as it possibly can, the consultants are going to have to put in the good. Absolutely. If you don't put in the good, that's where I'm going. So there may be a little bit of behavioral change.

**00:58:45 Speaker 2**  
I know that Karen and Dan are working on invoicing training notes.

**00:58:53 Speaker 1**  
Are they someone we should be talking to as well in the practice process? Just to understand? No, no.

**00:58:57 Speaker 2**  
No, it's just trying to encourage people to actually, instead of just saying "meeting with clients," to be a bit more...

**00:59:04 Speaker 1**  
Should we get their notes and put them into the system where when someone puts the notes in, click go, "Dan said you should do this instead. You haven't met Dan's criteria. On page two, line three, he said..."

**00:59:18 Speaker 7**  
But if people knew that their timesheet notes were going to be summarized for them, summarized into an invoice, they would be a lot more careful about what they write, because it has a purpose. Whereas at the moment, they can just write very basic, random things, and they kind of know what it means.

**00:59:37 Speaker 1**  
That's great. I think this is a really cool process. This could be quite a good process. It could save you time.

**00:59:43 Speaker 4**  
It's an interesting one, because it's a very simple process, but it's very time-consuming for projects, very time-consuming for project support, and relatively time-consuming for consultants. So we can definitely streamline, but I also don't want to completely overcook stuff. This is a simple process, and this is our quick and easy way.

**01:00:03 Speaker 1**  
Perfect. I think it is easier in the sense of - or easier is obviously subjective, but it's easier in the sense of - there's a slightly more defined start and finish time. We know what good looks like. We know there's already a current process and we're enhancing that. The other ones are slightly different. There's more variables. It's a bit more maybe... But also I think what will - my gut feel on this one - let's say we just fast forward six months or three months or whatever and there's some application you're starting to use it. I imagine that a couple months in, there might be a lot of - I feel the light bulbs go off and go "oh my gosh, we're now getting this data in real time or we couldn't before, or at the end of each month - wow, our reporting can be different now," or we will probably learn things about what we can get out of ProjectWorks and the nuance of what we don't know, the gaps that you know. Because it's so hard to explain every little detail, but what if through the process we realize we can pull data out of this and then we go "actually, could you report on this? You're getting that data anyway, we've always struggled to get this done."

And it's like there'll probably be spinoffs, if that makes sense. There's already a list of spinoffs.

**01:01:10 Speaker 3**  
Certainly through our experience internally, one of the things we've found is that there's little time savers that go into main processes that are really easy to automate, and they save wicked quick wins, and it's not a lot of work.

**01:01:27 Speaker 1**  
Especially once you've got something going.

**01:01:28 Speaker 4**  
One of the things we can't do in ProjectWorks is run reports by sector or service lines. We've got different services. If we go into the forecast report, we can't just say "show me asset management."

**01:01:40 Speaker 1**  
Is that right? Even though the data's all there, they just won't... Okay, so we can build another whole thing around...

**01:01:46 Speaker 4**  
A little quick win. Separate conversation. Future date. Because, A, it's 10 o'clock, and B, we just want to focus on our quick win with this. Because at the moment, it's two reports of the VLOOKUP.

**01:02:01 Speaker 1**  
Okay.

**01:02:01 Speaker 4**  
Every single Monday.

**01:02:03 Speaker 1**  
Oh, right.

**01:02:04 Speaker 4**  
But it's my time, which is non-billable to clients, so it's fine.

**01:02:09 Speaker 3**  
Yeah, but I need to be totally non-billable. That's automated now for me.

**01:02:14 Speaker 1**  
I'm starting to - yeah, it's so good. Now that's great. Thank you, Christina. Thank you so much. Just take care.

**01:02:24 Speaker 4**  
It's been fantastic, thank you. Definitely.

**01:02:30 Speaker 1**  
Thank you, Roxy. Thank you.

**01:02:33 Speaker 4**  
Does anyone need a coffee or a..? I was about to ask.
