00:00:00 Speaker 1 the the idea was i think we talked about this idea as being like knowledge platform opportunity discovery and and this one maybe is slight i don't know we need to pin down what this what what the kind of goal here is and explore what this could look like um uh yeah so what what's your we don't start with this one and i know that we actually do have a hard stop at 12. normally i we would probably have a more margin we actually had as we said a new staff member uh starting and. 00:00:30 Speaker 1 we've arranged a lunch a whole company lunch across the office so we're doing that at 12 30. 00:00:35 Speaker 2 yeah that's cool i don't think we'll i think we'll half an hour will be enough okay yeah. 00:00:39 Speaker 3 this one was basically basically sparked from, you talking at strategy day about wouldn't it be so great if you got all of these amazing leads from from that stuff right yeah that's all of me all. 00:00:55 Speaker 4 right all right yeah as in leads from places other than the government no no I. 00:01:00 Speaker 2 think so you and regional director was really like excited about this oh cool because so so what we do how we win work is because we were relationship based is that we go to our clients periodically and we talk about like what's what things are happening in their business and so we're not just. 00:01:32 Speaker 2 sitting there waiting, we go to them and say oh so you know you'll be your contracts that you know you'd like for example your waste contracts are expiring and you know a couple of years and you know how's it going have you thought about how you're gonna what you're gonna do next and so we there's this lead in time yeah we have right so we're trying to we're trying to sort of prime them to come to us and start the conversation about you know that projects which a year or two. 00:02:01 Speaker 1 years long duration that's and it's written this thing so yeah your Wi-Fi actually now I should be sorry it's the longest password you can act on yep yes, yeah you know I see I see I read it from your website it's a really cool one night I sure when I first thought that was a really cool one-liner, so because you're so you obviously do get some many emails and requests but but part of your your pipeline is actually drummed up by a. 00:02:33 Speaker 2 proactive work yeah so yeah so so what we have these sales plans and in the sales plans we'll have like different councils or or in the case of central government different agencies and we will identify like you know what what contracts might be expiring when or any project or any sort of investment or initiatives that they have that we know about and we put. 00:03:04 Speaker 2 them on the list against the you know a name to follow up with next time we you know we touch base with them right now. It's often hard to know what those things might be or to, you know, like we don't, over the years we've tried to sort of create and maintain databases on contracts and stuff and we do have sort of bits here and there about, you know, here are all the waste contracts that we know about from the collection contracts and predates or here are the parks and facilities contracts, but it's really hard to keep those things up to date. 00:03:42 Speaker 2 Now, there's a source of information that exists for every council, which is their long-term strategic plan, and those things are like, I mean, they're like huge. If you printed them out, they're perfect for keeping doors open. 00:04:00 Speaker 4 Yeah, they do. I always read Auckland councils, just for the record. Yeah, yeah. Well, I own a couple of houses out here and I want to know what's going on. 00:04:10 Speaker 2 And they are really good. And Auckland's actually pretty good at being quite straight to the point about what they're investing, what your rates go to and stuff. 00:04:19 Speaker 4 And I normally give them feedback too. 00:04:22 Speaker 2 Really. 00:04:22 Speaker 4 Yeah, I actually do. The stuff is available and it's important. If you own a house in Auckland, like I'm out in Harlandsville, I got a letter the other day and they're going to rezone my entire neighbourhood. Are they? Yeah, two houses. They're going to rezone it. 00:04:37 Speaker 2 Wow. Exactly. So, you know, these are the things. That's actually similar to what we want to know is like, what have you got in your budget. 00:04:47 Speaker 4 Yes, to do. 00:04:48 Speaker 2 To do. Like, for example, if I use a housing one, it's like, you know, some councils are looking to develop their... ... their elderly person's housing portfolios other councils are looking to sell them, and they're quite big quite big community decisions so they they put them in their ltps, um and say this is what we've got planned for the next three years you know um and what we want to be able to do is rather than having to like none of us read those bloody things unless. 00:05:28 Speaker 1 yeah you might might reactively do it because of a job you'll go find the information you need. 00:05:33 Speaker 2 yeah exactly yeah yeah but what we what we the opportunity we see with ai is actually to scan through them and tell you this is what are all yeah what are what are this what are the projects that are identified or what are they what are their investments or you know can you um, You know, can you find any, you know, maintenance or long-term service contracts that are expiring and that will be up for renewal. 00:05:59 Speaker 4 So what you would be is like, so example, what I'm hearing you want to do is scan like every council in the country's long-term strategic plans or their district and then get a summary of it and on the board it says, and gore, we're going to do this this day, da, that's what you're looking for, right. 00:06:16 Speaker 2 Yeah, but only filtering out all of the guff about, you know, we're going to, you know, work with our communities. 00:06:23 Speaker 4 Yeah, you just want to know what they're going to spend money on. 00:06:26 Speaker 2 They want to know only that, we just want to know what are the, where are your service, you know, what are you doing in terms of a service renewal or a service change or some new investment, you know, those sorts of things. 00:06:39 Speaker 1 Yeah, so it's basically, yeah, that's awesome. So clearly this is a very interesting, interesting. Yeah. Project I'm imagining so imagine if you've got like this world of world of of data What do you think would be most useful? So if we look at this idea of unstructured data and structured data, yeah structured data is like your project works. It's, specific clients, specific, Stages, it's specific inputs that are structured. Yeah, so. 00:07:13 Speaker 1 Would we want to have some kind of CRM-like interface or something, again, which could be searchable, findable, where we turn... Because it's one thing to just have a summarised version of all these documents, which is just more summaries to read. Probably more useful to have... If you could try and articulate... 00:07:32 Speaker 4 A planning tool. 00:07:33 Speaker 1 Yeah, yes, some kind of... Something that comes into being. Imagine if AI could plan by region, by this, by that. Yeah. Where you could sort, filter, search, and maybe even suggest, it could summarise, it could say, maybe, like, if you think about this, where it could go long-term, maybe it's got all that data, yes. It's like your assistant who's writing all the stuff. And then beyond that, it's agentic, as in it's also then looking at the previous work you've done for everything. And it's suggesting future work, and it's whatever. 00:08:04 Speaker 1 You can sort of imagine these things, that list of use cases will probably grow quite long, and the ability to develop all that. 00:08:11 Speaker 2 is just a matter of time well there's a subset of all of this yeah it's like clients that we've like you know done their procurement for them for example we want we want we could actually be like going through our own records and going when when does that contract yeah that's right it's again the same thing yeah so there's a few key data points it's like what what is the contract what is the service you know like what type of service is it what's the client what's the name of the client and when when does when does that um you know contract expire it's a contract or when. 00:08:44 Speaker 2 you know when when's the investment um if it's a you know something new yeah when's it got to be proposed yeah yeah so so for example um i'll give you an example another example like i read the napier city council ltp last year and it said in 2025 we're looking to review, our um, our suite of community halls. 00:09:10 Speaker 4 Yeah, there. 00:09:11 Speaker 2 Right. And so I touched base with them, and they said, oh, yeah, that's still on our program. Like, get in touch with us, you know, in about three months' time. 00:09:21 Speaker 1 Brilliant. So you're just reaching out. It's like, yeah. Yeah. 00:09:23 Speaker 2 Because we've read it, and we've gone, hey, we can help you with that. 00:09:26 Speaker 1 Fantastic. Yeah. And so if you hadn't done that, where would they go? Would they just go to the market, Google. 00:09:32 Speaker 2 Yeah, they'd either do it themselves, or they'd ring up someone else. 00:09:35 Speaker 1 Is that right. 00:09:36 Speaker 2 Yeah. Yeah, or they might just coincidentally ask. 00:09:42 Speaker 1 So, yeah. So if we were to, like, summon this writer, it would be something like, yeah, I mean, like I said, right, I literally, as I was saying, I was clearly speaking a vision, which is a very possible practical vision, of AI is really good at condensing massive information, right? This is one of its superpowers. So how do we harness that in a way, like a laser that gets an outcome for you guys, which is how does AI... wash through all that data and drop out the bottom potential leads. That'd be great, right? And then the enhancement on that could be how do we have a probability? 00:10:15 Speaker 1 How do we have a scheduling tool? How do we have expiry dates? How do we, you know, there's a whole lot of stuff that could make that really great. So imagine a database which gets filled of leads and it's just like, contract dates, renewals, maybe it's a self-documenting system relatively speaking, because it can handle the 200-page document from every council and we start to go so the perfect concept for this could be let's just handle one city, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. 00:10:38 Speaker 2 And then you just want, we only need one or two reference points to start off with. Yeah, and then we can work our way back and go actually, you know, like based on the fact that that's going to be released in 2027, we need to get in touch with them now. 00:10:52 Speaker 1 Yeah, that's right. 00:10:53 Speaker 2 So we don't need all the gaps filled in, like, but, It's that trigger thing. 00:11:00 Speaker 4 Yeah, it's that planning trigger. We need to think about this. We need to think about this today. 00:11:04 Speaker 1 Yeah, that's right. So a planning trigger based on that and then and then I think like that could be what I'm trying to think of it I'm trying to define like what a phase one could look like and then phase future phases could look like yeah every single item that it's found could then potentially do more lookups or more agentic type styles where it's been looking at your old jobs and getting more information and it was also done by Matt so I'm gonna put it on Matt's calendar to drop you an email yeah based on this thing I just found this. 00:11:37 Speaker 1 thing you did like whatever so I suggesting you leads and please call Jim. 00:11:41 Speaker 2 because you know what happens with councils and is that they often like, well there's a number that quite a I'd say a big percentage of the times when we reach out they haven't started but the fact that we're reaching out to them and saying oh, when are you going to start doing this? You know, we're happy to help you if you like. That actually initiates them to think, to go, oh. Yeah. Yeah, right. 00:12:06 Speaker 4 No, I was going to imagine. 00:12:07 Speaker 2 Because if you've got a contract that's 10 years, like a lot of waste contracts, for example, are 10 years, they run for 10 years. So the people who are running them now aren't the same people that wrote the document. And they're also not going to go and say, hang on. And they don't necessarily know what to do in terms of triggering a procurement exercise. So can you come to them and say, oh, your contract's expiring in two years' time. They're like, oh, yeah. And they're like, well, what are you going to do next? And then they start, the cogs start going, oh, shit. Actually, yeah, I've got to. 00:12:38 Speaker 5 Yeah. 00:12:39 Speaker 2 We've got to start now because it takes six months to order trucks even, for example, to run the collection service. So do you see what I mean? Like you're actually, you're creating the work. 00:12:49 Speaker 1 Yeah, yeah. 00:12:50 Speaker 4 It needs to be proactive, eh. 00:12:52 Speaker 2 Yeah. 00:12:52 Speaker 1 And then if you could come right demand like that, imagine a system which can create demand for a city, and then we could, over time, build it for a whole city. You can imagine, you could create demand anywhere, you just go, if you wanted to go into Melbourne you could, because you could just create demand in that city, right? It's just like a repeatable service. 00:13:11 Speaker 2 Yeah, so what we're trying to, I guess what we're trying to do is get that intel really quickly. Bottle it up. Because, I mean, we could pay someone to go and read, you know, 70 LTPs, but, 95% of the information in there is kind of like, it's not relevant to what we're trying to do. It's getting into that data. 00:13:37 Speaker 1 The challenge with that though, someone's going to read all that, and six months later they're going to go, now I understand it, what does this actually mean, and then they've forgotten the first thing. I think one of the benefits of AI, right, as we know, is it's great at connecting dots, so as long as we can get it, as long as we can have a, there's clearly a development process to do this well, but there's something in there which I think should be explored. So I'd love to try and trigger. I'd love to try. and clarify what would a proof of concept look like and what would be like a great outcome which we could try and yeah strive for because if there's any. 00:14:08 Speaker 1 work following this piece of work would be potentially to actually nail down a. 00:14:12 Speaker 2 proof of concept for you guys yeah totally I mean this inherently this look this I see if we just focus on the LTPs for a starter there's either two ways you could do it conceptually which is you either get someone to just go and download them all off the internet and dump them into something and tell it how to find the relevant information or even better thinking it goes and finds because these things are all public documents so it goes and finds them or the annual. 00:14:44 Speaker 2 plans or as well and stuff and actually searches them, online and comes back I don't know how easy that is. We would just need I mean. 00:14:54 Speaker 1 all plans I guess would have would be some would be PDF some would be websites. Are they all PDFs? They're all PDFs. Yeah I was gonna say most of them are yeah. 00:15:03 Speaker 2 So sometimes they're broken down into sections because they're so massive. Yeah right. So a website will be like part one part two part three. If someone on your end could. 00:15:11 Speaker 1 just put a spreadsheet together and and just like paste some URLs that would be a great start and then we could use that and eventually one between us we could have a have a long list. Yeah. Eventually that long list could be created. It's a finite list because there's only. Yeah yeah there will only be a hundred or or sixty or eighty. There's about seventy. Yeah and then the work on our side is okay as it was just like there'd be a piece of work to get the current list done and then does that like change every whatever it's like yeah those little things we could we could work on a way of it being self. 00:15:42 Speaker 1 documenting if possible because if AI can search the web for the thing then AI could search the thing every month and get the latest whatever that's like we have done but look initial let's say we used five urls we'll just find five urls and then our process would be take that pdf download it extract the data out of the pdf in a way that the llm can read it properly yeah and then we would chunk that down whether it be by section by whatever essentially some sort of a process where we turn this 200 page document into maybe a thousand chunks of useful information. 00:16:16 Speaker 1 which then we tag and metadata and then we start extracting off each of that we have to essentially do some process to get it from current state to end state yeah and that is a bit of a black box right now or you know a bit of a question mark yeah but if we if we carry on with what you're thinking let's say we used five examples or even just two yeah, What could an example output be, even just looking at one document or two documents. 00:16:44 Speaker 2 It would be... 00:16:45 Speaker 1 What structure could it look like. 00:16:46 Speaker 2 Oh, look, I think it's a table. 00:16:49 Speaker 1 A table. 00:16:49 Speaker 2 A table, and probably in Excel, because then you can add it. A table that just has some really basic information, which is client counsel, department, service, and contract, and then expiry date or commencement date. It's kind of something along those lines, you know, because that's sort of like... 00:17:17 Speaker 1 Those are... 00:17:17 Speaker 2 Those are the trigger things, right. 00:17:19 Speaker 1 Those are super easy. 00:17:19 Speaker 2 And we'll be able to go, oh, we know the person there who we can talk about. 00:17:22 Speaker 1 Perfect. I said, will they also... And then any other relevant information might be... But is it typically going to be that structure that's going to be buried in that document somewhere. 00:17:29 Speaker 2 Yeah. 00:17:30 Speaker 1 Somewhere in there, they're going to be like that, because I've never written myself. 00:17:33 Speaker 2 Or you can read between the lines, but where you can say... I mean, they have, because they have to say, hey, our contract is expiring in, you know, in 2027, so we're, you know, or we're, you know, like, you know, I may use that community halls example. It's a service change, so they have to tell the public that. So it's just, you know. there'll be key things that you know like keywords or things like review and. 00:18:03 Speaker 4 there is yeah we're reviewing this like if you read them they'll have yeah yeah yeah yeah there's very specific words in them that basically say what they're. 00:18:14 Speaker 2 gonna do yeah right or if you're looking at the financials that you could use to pull out you look at it because they might have a financial over the 10-year period and you can read it down the line and see a spike yeah. 00:18:27 Speaker 4 there you go that's as well so it might go which would mean they're budgeted for. 00:18:32 Speaker 2 it yeah it might be 10 200 yeah oh yeah okay so what's happening on you know year three that's where they're spending like 200 million bucks like what is that yeah so even if it's we don't quite know but we know that that's when they're planning to spend some money it'll pop well you. 00:18:50 Speaker 4 know because it'll be and I was gonna say it's bound to be somewhere else that actual expenditure will be somewhere else in the country, you, documents, you're just about finding it. 00:18:59 Speaker 1 Yeah, so I think that's a great point. I reckon one approach here could be to take one document, just one, and try and work out a way of extracting that document, especially if someone on your team knows one document really well. Then we can actually, it's actually easier to judge AI's output, but if we can work a system, even if you know the answers, which is great, the question is can we get the AI to know the answers that you know reliably, and if we can do that on one document, then we can do it on two, and then three, and then four, so rather than trying to boil the ocean initially, I'm trying to think, what if we pick one, document that maybe is familiar with everybody. 00:19:31 Speaker 4 Yeah, that all encounters. 00:19:31 Speaker 1 Because we might end up finding, yeah, we might find a lot of this kind of thing, right? Yes, maybe the document has ABC, but actually the real information's where the AI should now run a research task across that thing and find information elsewhere, and then collect that, and that could also make part of the table as well. So maybe it's like a multi-step process to really enrich, so you kind of have extraction, and then enrichment, if that makes sense. What I mean by that, it goes extracting, extracting data from. the table and then enriching that data potentially with other sources, which might be news sources. 00:20:03 Speaker 1 or other council website sources or whatever. 00:20:05 Speaker 4 There'll be other council documents, basically, aren't there. 00:20:09 Speaker 2 Well, as you were saying, the long-term plan, that's more holistic, right across all council services, but a big part of our business is waste. management as well and they that like again they have a standard they have their own plan right. minimization and management plan what wm mps they're called and so they're again like an lgp you have if you're a council you have to have one and it has to have two so we need to read. 00:20:42 Speaker 4 those as well yeah it's not so one of those yeah because they don't tell everyone needs to be in it because it's another sort of piece yeah um because even if you want to i'm sitting here thinking about the library right i don't know if you guys do library but that they've got to have their own plans as well that'll be different again so even yeah so auckland council's got their main overview but then they've got like you said they've got their wastewater plan they've got their water plan they've got their transport plan you actually i'm guessing you want to quote all of them right. 00:21:13 Speaker 2 uh we do and um but normally, for for the for the council like auckland council is a bit of a different beast because it's got, It's so big and it's also got these CCOs like to do like water care and Auckland Transport although Auckland Transport is being sucked back in but so probably a better example would be like a medium-sized council like Waikato District or something like that because then those are just sections of the LTP like so they're broken down by groups so it'll be like infrastructure group, community services, those sorts of things. 00:21:52 Speaker 2 And there's certain areas of the council's activities that we'd be more interested in. 00:21:59 Speaker 4 Yeah like for example right I live in Waipa, small district council but very wealthy. Our race course is going to be turned into 700 houses or something like that. 00:22:09 Speaker 5 Alright. 00:22:10 Speaker 4 That plan for that is already in, it's been out in paper for two or three years. They're miles away from doing anything. Right, right. But people like you would already be wanting to quote some of that work, right? Yes. Because they've got to be right, literally there's nothing there but a race course. 00:22:28 Speaker 1 Right. So everything has to be done. 00:22:29 Speaker 4 Everything has to be done. When we brought our house a year or so ago, they're nowhere near building it, but they've already got easements for the roading and stuff. So the planning for that is so far out, but you guys want to quote that well before it happens, correct. 00:22:45 Speaker 2 Well, because what we do is often even further. 00:22:50 Speaker 4 Back before that. 00:22:51 Speaker 2 Before, like, so if you're talking about a service or like, if you're talking about water infrastructure, for example, like we would be, we don't, we're not designers or... you know we it's once they say this is the project and this is where we're going to do it and all that it's almost too late for us yeah we're there we're there oh you know should you yeah should you, sell this land develop this land you know build you know like where should you you know who do you. 00:23:25 Speaker 2 need to get on board to do your wastewater treatment plant you know how much is it going to cost you, over 20 years, that's the bit that we do. So that's right, we do, we help them with the planning. 00:23:36 Speaker 4 That's right at the beginning, right? That's right at the beginning. 00:23:38 Speaker 2 Yeah, so what we wanna know is like. 00:23:40 Speaker 1 So probably like, we look at like, Northwest or something, where Costco went in. A long time ago, somebody thought Costco, Bunnings, Park Pick and Save, like, that entire, someone's gonna do something with a billion dollars in the next 10, 20 years. But before that. 00:23:55 Speaker 4 they had to put in roading, they had to put in pipes, they had to do all of that stuff before anyone even did anything. 00:24:00 Speaker 1 There's obviously transports to put roads in and bull houses and there's so much, yes. 00:24:05 Speaker 4 And you guys are right at that beginning stage. 00:24:07 Speaker 2 Well, yeah, so that's where we, like, so we would look at a, like, let's say we looked at a 10-year long-term plan. We would be, it might be, the first seven years, might show that the wastewater treatment plant, is just ticking along and it's a, it'll have, 50-50, 50-50, and then you see this big spike, and then you know that, well, that's because they're budgeting for, they don't, for replacing that piece of kit, you know, 00:24:37 Speaker 2 because it's at the end of its useful life. That's how we use that information. So we know that in five years' time, they've got a potential project on their books, which is to renew their wastewater treatment plant. 00:24:51 Speaker 1 Yeah. 00:24:51 Speaker 2 And so we work our way back and go, well, three years out, we're going to be talking to them. 00:24:56 Speaker 1 Yeah, cool. 00:24:57 Speaker 2 So, like, you know, procuring the designers, the contractors, the new maintenance. Yeah, great. 00:25:05 Speaker 4 So that very first mention in the plans are your first real trigger, aren't they? Yes, they are, yeah. So the really first thing about this is, you know, this is what we're looking at reviewing. Yeah. That's actually the trigger. Once you get to the stage where Race Scores Road is at, you guys have already done your work. 00:25:25 Speaker 1 Yeah. Okay, great. All right. So does that sound like an interesting approach? Yes. To perhaps, for us to work with just a single document and basically hone and refine a process which could work with a single document, refine the outputs, refine what that could look like, test them in the technology, and then if that can work across a single document, that could prove a concept, which could then justify further investment, which might be, if it's going to work for one document, it could work for 50, it could work for 200 documents. It could work in New Zealand, it could work in Australia, 00:25:56 Speaker 1 it could work whatever. Same idea. 00:25:59 Speaker 4 What do you see as the outcome? So how do you envision the end? So I kind of get to where you want, right? But how do you want it to look. 00:26:09 Speaker 2 I don't think it doesn't have to be flash. It just needs to be... It needs to be, as I say, like, it can simply be a spreadsheet that has, like, these are all the councils, and these are our council clients. This is a list of, like, the different activity areas, I suppose. Yeah, yeah, yeah, like water, the service areas, yeah. Yeah, it's all standardised, so we can filter by that. And these are the, you know, the big investment areas and projects and contract renewals and all that sort of stuff. 00:26:43 Speaker 2 And so having all of that in one place, and us just being able to use it to inform our, like, okay, so who are we going to go and talk to over the next few months. 00:26:51 Speaker 1 Yeah, cool. 00:26:52 Speaker 2 So, you know, the fields that I talked about, or the columns, don't have to be... too massive to start out yeah because you'd start with that and then go okay well if we want to do some smarts how do we you know yeah i think that's the base and work out from there. 00:27:07 Speaker 1 i think that's great i think that i think the starting point basically a really sophisticated extraction system is for me what feels like a great starting point and then once it's actually being used by the team and the first time you guys sit around the table and look at this list, you might start going okay how cool would it be if we could also do this other thing or if that becomes then your trigger in action so then your if this happens and if it's this thing why don't you also do more research and that's you can start to maybe build out more um agentic processes or ai processes maybe cross-referencing it against your crm data maybe previous job data. 00:27:41 Speaker 1 maybe yeah looking up linkedin to look for who's whatever all those kind of other things might reveal themselves as being added value benefits yeah um but none of it will be possible unless you've got the basics done yeah yeah exactly we're reliably extracting data from these sources. 00:27:58 Speaker 2 because what we're trying to do is is stop this kind of we have these meetings and we go does anyone know yeah yeah it's kind of you know what's happening yeah at yp district you know yeah does anyone know anyone there yeah what's happening you know and it's just random whether whether someone goes, oh yeah yeah i know you know i know their infrastructure manager you know, or whatever yeah you know like it's kind of we we fall into this trap of not doing it methodically and scientifically yeah so how cool so so a vision could be. 00:28:34 Speaker 1 spreadsheet or basic web app with a table look search and filter contract sparring next four years and it just shows you everything it's like by district by service and you guys just eyeballing it and going oh yeah we know that and that's where you guys just in a room chat like oh I forgot about that oh I didn't know that but it's the fact that it's there in your mind outside out of mind it's now inside in mind it's essentially brilliant yeah and then you. 00:29:00 Speaker 4 guys can just basically make your own plans yeah we go back to the session we had before we were talking about the what were they the method and the track record and how we were going to use the knowledge yes yes yep we could use that same concept to get all the past jobs to complete half of it, Then you've got, you've got all, can't you use that same extraction methodology to actually get all the current ones that are going to expire. 00:29:30 Speaker 2 Potentially. 00:29:31 Speaker 4 And get that time frame internal. 00:29:33 Speaker 2 Oh, you mean from our own data. 00:29:35 Speaker 4 Yeah, from your own data. That we've already worked on, so we can go back and see what we've done before. And that's what I'm, is that complete. 00:29:41 Speaker 1 Yeah, that's part of. 00:29:42 Speaker 4 So that's half of it, basically, is the knowledge they've already got. The other half of it is the knowledge from the web. 00:29:48 Speaker 1 Yeah, that's right. So you can kind of imagine phase 1.1 is extracting data and then enriching that data with previous data as well. And then you could imagine like this system becomes very sophisticated. But so useful. It has to stay simple, but great. 00:30:05 Speaker 2 Simple is good, eh. 00:30:07 Speaker 1 Yeah. Keep it simple. It's key things. 00:30:10 Speaker 3 Are there also some spreadsheets floating around with contract expiry dates. 00:30:14 Speaker 1 And that might be it. 00:30:16 Speaker 4 And just reading that all into one place already. 00:30:19 Speaker 1 If there are examples of that, essentially what we took, like your example of, you could hire someone to do it full time. Or you could just have a system which does it automatically. And it's like self-documenting. And every month or whatever, I don't know whether it be a weekly process or monthly process, there's some sort of a recheck. Do these things get announced by the news or anything? Do they just kind of get announced. 00:30:41 Speaker 2 No, not until it's too late for us. Yeah. 00:30:46 Speaker 1 Do you get notified of new documents? Do you guys have an email inbox where it's like, Inquiries at Morrison Lowe. And someone will get a subscription, RSC's feed. Are there things like that? I don't know. That'll be RSC Speed, all of them. And then whenever we trigger it, like the same minute, we just know it's there. 00:31:08 Speaker 2 When you say that, what do you mean. 00:31:10 Speaker 1 So just like, imagine like, RSC Speed is every website. someone let you subscribe to it, someone we might have just scraped or something. Imagine like a blog. Let's say someone released a new blog. Boom. That minute, that thing gets posted with a date and timestamp. Typically, an RSS feed system is listening for a new entry of a system. 00:31:32 Speaker 2 A new plan. 00:31:34 Speaker 1 So if we had a finalist of sites, 60 sites, 100 sites, potentially each one of them either has some kind of RSS feed, which we could tap into, or we could make our own version. So every day we're listening for something new. And that is a trigger. Let's say that they've announced something. Our system could listen for an announcement and boom, scrape it in. 00:31:54 Speaker 2 So it's not like, you know, it's not happening every day or week. 00:31:59 Speaker 1 I know, I imagine it's not. 00:32:01 Speaker 2 You know, like you've got your, so if you look at the LTPs, they're a rolling like three year plan. So they look out 10 years. And so currently councils are 24 to 27. So now they'll be working on, they'll be working on the, their next LTP iteration which will go from 27 to 30, but it still has a 10 year forecast in it for everything, but it's detailed for that 3 years, and then they release an annual plan which updates it, so it's like 10 year, 3 year annual cycles, and there's no monthly check-in updates, but it's useful to look at the annual plans each year when they come out. 00:32:46 Speaker 4 because they come out at about April-ish. It's always the same time, right, because they're going to the fiscal year. And they actually ask for the public submission, so that's why I read it, because I want to give them like 10 cents. 00:32:59 Speaker 2 So your LTP is like a, imagine your, if you think about it like a household, your LTP is like, oh, in 10 years I want to pay off my mortgage. Yeah. And three years is like, this is what I'm going to be doing for the next three years because I know that I'll be working, what my salary is going to be for the next three years. I can work that out quite accurately. And then the annual plan is that, well, this is what I'm paying. Yes, fortnight or each month. Yeah exactly what it is. So yes, it's a level of accuracy. 00:33:34 Speaker 2 Yes, and so that annual plan changes. It does tweak and change we can change what the long-term plan sort of. 00:33:41 Speaker 4 If you get a change of Mia, you get a bigger change. 00:33:44 Speaker 2 So right. So yeah, the LTP is really useful to us because it, Was really long-term things are always in there. 00:33:53 Speaker 1 Yeah, they are and even even law even government changes what can't they don't know that I've raised those They will just change the next subsequent three-year plan. Yeah. Yeah, it's only the council to decide that their priorities might change. 00:34:05 Speaker 2 Very interesting. That's super interesting. Yeah, so I think from here just think about. 00:34:14 Speaker 1 You know, it doesn't matter. Yeah, just because we have to get a bit The office, but I think it's awesome stuff. It's been such a great meeting. I think it's been awesome Yeah. 00:34:29 Speaker 3 In the time. 00:34:29 Speaker 1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's I think it's been a good message. I think three hours has been great. Like it's easy to, Talk longer, but I think it's just been awesome, Yeah for me I'm thinking about the next steps and I think maybe picking one plan could be great We could do some initial looking on our side and yeah start, Massaging like what this thing could look like. There's a lot to process on our end, but I've got AI transcribing everything So yeah, I'm gonna use I'm gonna definitely use my own dog food and and boom three transcripts three summaries. 00:35:03 Speaker 1 It's going to help us to I can see those as well if we want to help us to, Solidify, I think creating clarity is like definitely the the key thing from here So we're super clear on the three objectives and in plans and then with it Then we all be able to really run as fast as we can to them to the next steps and the next meetings We'll book and and all that sort of thing. Yeah, and my role I guess. 00:35:26 Speaker 2 From my perspective is to say just to kind of like try and tighten the scope of this Yeah We're not trying to bite off Yeah, you know because like we're gonna get and and I are gonna have to well, we're accountable. Almost this is more with us Like if we can show something that's that like a proof of concept like this this big but works really well It's better than like. 00:35:58 Speaker 3 The brains of fire, yeah. Yeah Yeah, yeah. 00:36:04 Speaker 2 Because the people that we're engaging with internally, like our senior leadership, are miles behind, you know, where we are. 00:36:13 Speaker 4 In their uptake. 00:36:15 Speaker 2 Well, yeah, in their uptake, but also their kind of, like, conceptualising of, like, how this could actually work. 00:36:22 Speaker 1 They're really trusting this process is going to help reveal certain benefits to them. 00:36:27 Speaker 2 But they'll be like, well, what are you doing and where is it? But, you know, like, because they still have that, I mean, to a degree, they have that mindset of, like, you look around and you decide what you're going to buy and you buy it and then it's there. 00:36:39 Speaker 5 Yeah. 00:36:40 Speaker 2 Whereas, that's not the case. 00:36:41 Speaker 1 This is more development. Yeah, it's like, it's kind of like, yeah, it's like gardening. You plant some seeds and you go away and you've got to water it every day. Maybe we'll start seeing some shoots in a few weeks. And if we've done the right job, it'll be a fruit tree in a minute, in enough time. 00:36:57 Speaker 3 We are very fortunate that the company does want to invest, they know it's important, they understand the value, so we are very lucky that we actually are in an environment where they want to invest and explore, so it's, yeah. 00:37:12 Speaker 2 But they're just results driven, right. 00:37:14 Speaker 3 But they do, yeah. 00:37:14 Speaker 2 Fair enough, yeah. 00:37:15 Speaker 4 Yeah, we're finding that constantly, eh? Like, we're so far ahead in our mindset that the average person hasn't quite, they haven't got there yet, and we quite often have to stop and think, oh, that's right, they don't get that. They haven't got there yet. You know, because we've been living and breathing it for 15, 18 months now. 00:37:36 Speaker 3 I mean, we do have an internal program that we need to sort of really get. That AI fluency. 00:37:44 Speaker 1 Yeah, really cool. 00:37:45 Speaker 4 It's about, you know what I think really gets buy-in? Is if you can show them that one little thing that's going to actually make a difference in their little world. That's what the invoicing thing is. That's, I hear you, yes. It's more, hey, wow, cool. Yeah. I want more. 00:38:00 Speaker 5 Yeah, yeah. 00:38:00 Speaker 4 Yeah, and that's, yes. I think that's what we need to focus. 00:38:05 Speaker 2 When I reflect on this morning, it's probably, possibly could be the trickiest one. Yeah. Which one. 00:38:12 Speaker 1 The invoicing? Yeah, yeah. The easiest. Actually, because this output of this document could be relatively quick compared to an invoicing application, which could be much longer. Yeah, who knows, right? It's funny, right? Yeah. 00:38:27 Speaker 4 Having said that, we've done a few invoices, so we've got a bit under our belt on that one. 00:38:34 Speaker 1 It still doesn't mean it's easy, it just means it's straightforward. Actually, this knowledge one, if we try and boil the ocean, it's a big job, but if we just focus on extracting data from a PDF, that's actually relatively straightforward. It's a bit of scoping and a bit of development, and we'll go, here it is, does it look good? If you're like, no, okay, we'll try again, does it look good? Yeah, pretty close. That's much easier than how do we roll out an invoicing platform, because we've got change. 00:39:06 Speaker 1 management with invoicing, at least because the part that's hard with invoicing is that you're changing people's processes. The part that's not so hard with the extraction of data is you're not changing anything, you're creating something out of nothing. So if you're just like, sweet, or not sweet, there's no change in our behaviour, it's just much easier in terms of the change in our environment.
