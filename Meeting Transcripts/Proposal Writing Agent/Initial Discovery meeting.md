00:00:24 Speaker 1 I was going to say, is there a colour that you're doing, a coordination? No, because there were three oranges and two of each other colour, so I had to eat the orange one. I'm not ADHD at all. I used to like it when I got the big, big boxes of strawberries. I used to eat all the red ones and not play with the other ones. 00:00:45 Speaker 2 I remember when they had that ad on TV years ago, eat the red ones last. Am I really showing my age now? They literally, the Smarties ad was, you eat the red ones last. In the 80s. Oh, God, I'm old. 00:01:01 Speaker 3 I freaked out when I found out that red food colouring was made from the shell of a beetle. 00:01:09 Speaker 2 Did you know that? All food colouring is terrible for you. You know those hundreds and thousands? Yeah. So I've got a bit of a dodgy bile duck, right? I went and had hundreds and thousands on a Sunday, the other day, at a restaurant. My bile duck screamed at me for two weeks. 00:01:28 Speaker 4 Oh, really. 00:01:28 Speaker 2 It wanted to burst out of my body because of the colouring. Oh, right. Hundreds and thousands. I don't know what's in it, but it ain't good for you. It is not good for you. 00:01:47 Speaker 1 Right, over to you, Chris. 00:01:50 Speaker 5 All right. So, we were going to be talking through how AI can help the org generate proposals and, digging into some of that. You mentioned last time you were playing around with Copilot and doing some stuff and you've already potentially reduced a bit of your own time through your learning, but we're thinking about how we... I guess there's two or three things here from me. Number one is I think we want to gain a better understanding of the types of proposals you're. 00:02:22 Speaker 5 doing, because for us to work or for us to essentially build a good AI system of what it could look like, I think we would need potentially some great examples of proposals, potentially example types, maybe in different sectors or different areas. And then we could talk about... the challenges of proposal writing today and some goals around the reduction of time or whatever. 00:02:53 Speaker 5 What does quality even look like? All those kind of things I'm keen to dig into. And then what could an end state potentially look like? I think last time we talked about again some kind of potential custom AI solution which you could punch in something and look at AI vending machine proposals. Punch something in and out comes a proposal. It may or may not be that perfect but I think the goal could be something like, it'd be great to have an all-star of what we're trying to achieve. So my thoughts were, I don't know where we start necessarily, but in my planning for this, it'd be great to map out the. 00:03:29 Speaker 5 current invoice workflow. Oh sorry, I'm reading the wrong thing. Here we go, we've just done that one. I did it around the wrong way on the proposal I sent through to you. I have work stream one as proposal generation. Different practice areas for proposal workflows. um what does quality look like what what is like what is your learnings around using ai already in proposal writing where is it getting it wrong or right because i think a lot of you know ai is garbage and garbage out so what does good um proposal inputs look like and i think we must. 00:04:03 Speaker 5 have at some point we should analyze past successful or great proposals so that we can train the models or teach a model or guide a model in writing good proposals do we need some kind of taxonomy or some kind of um um you know waste assessment strategic plans procurement and whatever the different you know um areas are can i just start a couple of quick questions. 00:04:26 Speaker 2 so how many proposals do you guys do a year lots like yeah i thought you were going to say a week, all right yeah a week how many would you do a week across the company. 00:04:41 Speaker 3 I don't know because it kind of weighs, that's why I kind of picked a year. 00:04:45 Speaker 2 And do you have an idea how many, no I don't know about it, so I'm going to have to decide. And what sort, are they like everyone's different or are they 80% similar. 00:04:55 Speaker 6 There's some standard text that goes in all of them. Okay, so there's a standard text. We've got a template, like our headings are always the same. 00:05:02 Speaker 1 This is our standard template, there's a couple of variations, obviously there's a landscape version and so on. 00:05:10 Speaker 2 So we've got a template and templates in Word. 00:05:13 Speaker 5 So the templates in Word in terms of like the actual structure. 00:05:19 Speaker 2 Are you quoting like all sorts of things or are they similar type things. 00:05:26 Speaker 3 Well there's commonality in the sense that it always, like you see those contents. We always put in like who's going to be, who we're going to do it. We always put in like a methodology. 00:05:43 Speaker 2 But in terms of what you're actually quoting, I'm just trying to understand what your actual business is. I understand that you're doing quotes for the government, but are you doing like, roading and then maybe weather, or are you doing only roading? Do you know what I mean? It's very varied. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to get to. Have you talked about the matrix, because that's probably... No, that's what I was going to talk about. Yeah, the matrix. 00:06:08 Speaker 6 So we have our business divided, not divided, but we classify the projects by the market they serve, which could be roading, could be borders, could be solid waste facilities. That's what I wanted to get to. That's the market. But then we have service lines as well, which is, is it a procurement job, is it a service review, is it a due policy. 00:06:36 Speaker 2 So within roading you could have different service lines, within waste you could have different service lines. So it's broken down. 00:06:42 Speaker 3 And service lines are more aligned with the actual, the outputs that we're, that we're doing. 00:06:47 Speaker 2 What you're proposing. 00:06:49 Speaker 3 Are we doing a business case or are we doing a review, you know, operational review or are we doing a, are we helping to procure a service or a piece of infrastructure. 00:07:01 Speaker 5 So your matrix is like market across service line down and you'd have, oh, here we go. Cool. 00:07:09 Speaker 2 Nice. 00:07:09 Speaker 1 So what we've got there is these are our service lines. So asset management, finance and economics, organisational procurement, policy and strategy programme, service operational review, strategic advisory. So those are our service lines. 00:07:22 Speaker 6 So a proposal for service review say would be similar regardless of which market it was. 00:07:29 Speaker 2 Yeah. 00:07:30 Speaker 1 and then so the markets across our service lines those are essentially the services that we do, um even within those there is variation not every asset management project is the same but then yeah it would slot into one of these markets this is across nz and aussie yeah so you. 00:07:48 Speaker 2 do work for aussie government as well as new zealand government uh we do yeah local government. 00:07:52 Speaker 3 local government local aussie and aussie is slightly different than it is in new zealand. 00:07:56 Speaker 2 because it's they have three tiers rather than with the federal with the states yeah so state government over there but it still fits in the same yeah it's the same concept yeah okay um so, there are similarities you can find them so and i'm guessing if you then go back to your project template probably, 70% of that is on all of them, and then the other 30% has changed, or have I... 00:08:28 Speaker 2 That's probably, if it's a standard project, if it's one that we've done before, yes. Yeah, so that's 70%. 00:08:36 Speaker 6 But the bit that changes a lot is the... 00:08:39 Speaker 2 The 30%. 00:08:40 Speaker 6 The methodology. The methodology, yeah. Or there's a heading there, our understanding of your requirements. 00:08:45 Speaker 7 Yeah. 00:08:46 Speaker 6 That's different for everyone. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're showing our understanding of their context. The methodology gets tweaked from project to project, and then the track record is one that does my head in every time. 00:08:59 Speaker 5 Oh, really? Yeah. 00:09:00 Speaker 3 The track record is always the difficult one. Yeah, because you've got... 00:09:05 Speaker 5 Okay. 00:09:05 Speaker 3 Because we've been around for 25 years now, and we've done pretty much everything we've done before, you know? And so you want... Like, what we're wanting to demonstrate is... our experience but we don't like Karen and I don't know the machine knows. 00:09:27 Speaker 5 machine knows that sounds like a great thing we've done this, this for these people. 00:09:33 Speaker 6 we're trying to show you like three different record projects for each one but finding which ones are the most relevant. 00:09:40 Speaker 5 so in AI that's its own piece of work it's like how we build a track record system right that's kind of really cool. 00:09:48 Speaker 3 even if you could nail that the rest of it is kind of straight forward. 00:09:51 Speaker 5 yeah okay that's a really good thing to hone in on as well. 00:09:53 Speaker 6 yeah it is. 00:09:54 Speaker 5 because a prerequisite to getting track records is to get data and so then we start working backwards right we go alright this is great. 00:10:01 Speaker 3 because what will happen like sorry Karen but like, what will typically happen when I write one for example and it's probably the same but you can add to this, is that I will say to Ewan oh have we ever done this before and people are going oh yeah think about it, like five years ago or whatever, And then you'll go and do a search in a rough sort of like job number band of like, and do a search on a client or whatever. And then you'll try and you might actually find the job, but then you've got to buddy summarise it. 00:10:36 Speaker 3 Yeah, yeah. And you didn't do it, you know. Because you really, all you want is a short paragraph about what we did and what the outcome was. And that's basically it, right. 00:10:47 Speaker 6 And I have found Copilot is good at, it's hit and miss on finding the projects, but it is quite good at saying, you know, we've already, in the Copilot chat, we've already established what is important to this client and what this proposal is about. You know, here's some track record projects, but can you summarise them emphasising, like. in relation to this project. So I mean even when we've got standard summaries, there's still room for improvement to come out of this. 00:11:23 Speaker 6 What are we trying to emphasise on this one? And that comes within our understanding of your requirements section. No, that comes in the track record. 00:11:32 Speaker 3 Because you might use one project for three different proposals, but the different aspects of that one project are going to be emphasised across each one. 00:11:42 Speaker 6 So I know, I've told Kaupāna you have to, when it's finding projects, you have to read the whole report. You can't just go by the file names because they're not saved under this. So you've got to find the most relevant ones. Time is also a factor, right? There's a balance of how old is that project. 00:12:02 Speaker 5 Yeah, true. But I can imagine some kind of like, so when we think about data, there are... there are ways what i'm thinking about here is imagine a process where we sort of take a hundred documents or a thousand or whatever and we should actually do what's called like a pre-processing step where we could actually use ai to categorize tag pre-summarize yeah pull out key terms and that all becomes metadata yeah which then gets tagged against that so ai doesn't have to necessarily. 00:12:33 Speaker 5 read every document it just finds the you know what i mean so we actually have like a we can almost build an ai process instead which takes your documents creates a great set of metadata, around it maybe it pulls out all keywords maybe there's a maybe there's i don't know what it would be regarding you'd have to think about what you think about this together but definitely keywords, tags whatever maybe 100 word summary 100 maybe a thousand word summary maybe a whatever pre-make all that so then your ai is taking like much less heavy lifting and you can also say find me every. 00:13:04 Speaker 5 every proposal that's got the word waste management it's not having to summarize everywhere, again it just looks, programmatically at everything that's been pre-tagged and then it's already filtered down to the seven and then it summarizes those ones it makes sense So it's essentially trying to work with our data smartly to take the heavy lifting away, So that when you when an AI is trying to achieve a result, it's basically much faster much more accurate, These are the kind of what we call like a post processing or pre-processing step, So the data still lives on SharePoint, but you almost have this entire even they're like Netflix, right? 00:13:38 Speaker 5 It was with our experience is great. I just search for a word and it knows, producer or the year or the actors name yeah I don't have you know I mean like. 00:13:49 Speaker 6 it's already kind of in there somewhere doesn't make sense yeah what if we could. 00:14:00 Speaker 5 only yeah what if I could only search on title I would never find what I want right I want to search comedy I want to search Steven Spielberg I want to search 80s you know I mean like yeah so it's the same idea imagine that type search search engine across your proposals what if we built like this basically in this type of called metadata so we could use that metadata we can almost build a metadata library and then what if you could we get you do this sort of two reasons we could have you guys have a search like a Netflix and find me bubble but I know this searches your proposal documents really fast and easy. 00:14:31 Speaker 5 yeah click or something some sort of a whatever and or the AI could use it as well so I'm just thinking out this out loud, About this basically making a much more intelligent search engine than SharePoint itself. Yeah But also giving it more than one use case could be for humans and for AI. Yeah. 00:14:52 Speaker 6 Okay, okay. Yes, which is that's where I started using Proposals and I actually found that was quite frustrating and I had a lot more success using the project folder, Right, because those then it's building that track record based off the final report, Yeah, the technology is better looking in the proposals for what other proposals that we've written. Yes, Yeah, because it's like what you promised to do is what you actually did what was the outcome. 00:15:28 Speaker 5 Yeah, and then and there's probably report documents which you've written as well. So would one job end to end, Basically the original proposal, plus all the time sheet data and invoices you sent, and then probably some reports and assets that you made relating to that, all bundled in a single... 00:15:45 Speaker 6 So the project folder has the proposal in it. 00:15:49 Speaker 5 Oh, okay, great. So there'd be like anything, anywhere from two assets to like 10 or 15 or lots, potentially, depending on the project size. But yeah, that's excellent. That's really interesting. And is there some kind of, you know, set of like the outputs you're making? Are they also relatively standardized? Like it's a proposal, it's a report on something, it's a something like... 00:16:15 Speaker 3 There's different classes. 00:16:16 Speaker 5 Different classes as well? Do you sort of... I'm trying to think about tagging and categorization as well. Would there be like 15 categories or a thousand. 00:16:23 Speaker 6 It's probably in the different service lines, some are more standard than others. 00:16:28 Speaker 5 Yeah. So what if you could say like, find me every waste management something or other, and it just like... pulled the list of 10, and then you say, use those 10 to generate this, and it just like, does it quickly. 00:16:41 Speaker 3 Yeah, I think that would be the, that would be kind of, there needs to be sort of a filter. 00:16:44 Speaker 6 doesn't it, first off? Yeah, I think, certainly in procurement, there's some very standard documents. 00:16:50 Speaker 5 Yeah, great. 00:16:50 Speaker 6 Just update with the details, but then in the other service lines, it's more of a cut. 00:16:56 Speaker 5 Yeah, it's a super interesting idea. 00:16:57 Speaker 6 I think there's probably a time and time. 00:16:58 Speaker 5 I do think that sort of Netflix or Spotify type metadata searching is a good, a good picture for me, when I'm thinking as a user, what if, if your end result is a great track record, I'm trying to think backwards and be like, what can I, what does the user experience look like for you guys as you're writing documents? But also, how do we steer a model in the right way? And what does that all look like? And I think there's something in there which I would love to explore. 00:17:23 Speaker 3 The way you go about building a business case is pretty standard. It's the same as the way you go about doing an asset management plan. You can kind of tie a methodology to an output, to a degree. Would that be fair to say. 00:17:44 Speaker 2 I think so. So, I think so. What's the other really long... So, in terms of putting the proposal together, obviously one of your biggest pain points is the track record. What's your other big pain point from that proposal? Oh, the methodology. The methodology. 00:18:02 Speaker 5 Okay. Yeah. 00:18:03 Speaker 2 So how's that derived. 00:18:05 Speaker 5 Can we see an example proposal as well while we're ... Is there like one particular one that's ... 00:18:09 Speaker 2 Strike record is basically history, right? Yeah. So it's proving the history. So that's pretty ... 00:18:14 Speaker 5 But it has to be really relevant to the reader about what the work is and ... Yeah, yeah, yeah. 00:18:17 Speaker 2 But the methodology, I'm guessing, is very specific for what you're proposing, correct. 00:18:23 Speaker 7 Yeah. 00:18:23 Speaker 6 Yes, but there are similarities within the type of deliverable. Yeah. There are similarities. Having said that, though, ask Copilot a really interesting question. I've got it ... We narrowed down to a list of service reviews, which is a very standard thing. I would have expected this to be the same. But we narrowed it down to a list of track records or good examples of service reviews, and I told it, forget about the proposals, what we said we were going to do. Reading the reports, what did we actually do, because that can be quite different. 00:18:54 Speaker 6 Summarize the methodologies in each of these projects. Okay. What are the similarities and what are the differences and why did we do it differently? What did the client get out of it? And it gave me a fantastic table which I gave to Rotorua saying this is our standard approach to a service review and this is why and then these are some of the optional things that we can talk about adding in or out. 00:19:17 Speaker 1 Nice. 00:19:18 Speaker 6 I don't always go with that but it was interesting. 00:19:26 Speaker 1 One of the things we also can consider with proposals is that if we are using a Fireflies or a meeting tool, is that we can use that to populate so that our understanding of your needs, our methodology, because we're having a meeting, we're talking about your needs, and actually being able to use that transcript into the proposal as well. 00:19:49 Speaker 5 A hundred percent, that's excellent. It's a great asset. 00:19:52 Speaker 6 Along with some of our own research. 00:19:54 Speaker 1 That's right. Absolutely, yeah. We're never going to rely entirely on the tool, we still have to have jobs for us. 00:20:05 Speaker 2 Is the methodology, is there similarities along the lines, so the machine could somewhat pull up, say for example, and I'm just thinking like we're doing a waste job, we use this methodology on the last four waste jobs, and then is that similarity enough that you could make a summary for the methodology. 00:20:30 Speaker 6 Probably in the service lines rather than the markets, probably. Close. I guess my question is more, do we want to stick with the methodologies that we're using, or do we actually use Copilot to write a better methodology based on what we actually do. 00:20:47 Speaker 3 I think you need to do a bit of both, because I'm mindful that we could go down a potentially risky pathway with being sort of like... much revisionist and going backwards in terms of how we do things rather than forwards because it's like just going oh we did this the last 10 times we did this this is how we did it and it's like actually that might not be what what our clients need because we want to learn from project. 00:21:18 Speaker 2 to project on how to do it better true um i guess the thing is methodology is basically only one little paragraph i know that no that's not it i was going to just the most random i was going to say and you spend hours on one little paragraph what about that animal management yeah case one. 00:21:36 Speaker 3 um auckland council if you go to auckland uh three oh it's near the top um the shelter business case that one three eight proposal better be in there um hang on it's the it's that one uh hang on, Yeah, that one, is that a seven. 00:22:02 Speaker 5 It's a business case. Yeah. 00:22:03 Speaker 3 Seven nerve. 00:22:05 Speaker 2 How many people involved in the proposal writing. 00:22:09 Speaker 3 One main person. 00:22:11 Speaker 2 So it's primarily you, Karen. 00:22:13 Speaker 6 No, no, we all do it. 00:22:15 Speaker 5 Every consultant does their own proposals. 00:22:16 Speaker 6 Every consultant does it. Yeah. So there's always at least an author and a reviewer. Sometimes there's two authors. Okay. 00:22:23 Speaker 5 Ah, so there's always an author, a reviewer, and an AR reviewer. Yeah, so a proposed approach. And an AR author. Yeah, that's the methodology, right. 00:22:30 Speaker 3 Yeah. 00:22:31 Speaker 1 Right. 00:22:31 Speaker 3 So that's probably more normal, like, you know, like we've got five phases. 00:22:37 Speaker 1 Okay, so it's pages, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Basically five pages. 00:22:40 Speaker 3 It's different phases. And it's the phased approach, so we do, we'll do, so even having the bones of it are like, you know, this is a one phase, two phase, three phase kind of. yeah yeah project is probably quite helpful way like even if it's just sitting out like what that structure looks like I really like the. 00:23:12 Speaker 6 I really liked the idea of going, you know, if we've done this five times before, what would we do the same? What would we do differently? Yeah. What are the options that I've got for the methodology? Okay, rather than saying this is the... 00:23:25 Speaker 5 Yeah. 00:23:26 Speaker 6 What are the options for the methodology? Yeah. 00:23:27 Speaker 5 Such a great point, eh? Like, do we... Springing it all. But the outcome of this, do we really want it to be writing a proposal? Do we want it to be feeding information to help the person write the bit of proposal? Yeah. I think that's a different thing, right. 00:23:37 Speaker 7 Exactly. It is. 00:23:37 Speaker 5 Because it's one thing for us to go, write a proposal and watch it write for you, and you're going to go, uh, not sure. Right. 00:23:42 Speaker 7 Yeah, yeah. 00:23:43 Speaker 5 Another thing to have data, insights, et cetera, and maybe some kind of interface which grows over time, which maybe lets you build a proposal in front, like... Or you're straddling between two screens and you're copying into Word documents or whatever, and one day it's maybe all in one or something, but you don't have to go that fancy. You could have something which is more data insights driven, and maybe you click new proposal... I'm trying to think on the spot, like a sort of a workflow. Maybe you click new... client, or you pick the client, and then by clicking that, the AI knows the client, 00:24:18 Speaker 5 and you've already got baked in system prompts and whatever. I'm just imagining it out loud. Okay, you pick a service line from the matrix, and you click it. This is what we're going to be doing. Perfect. It kind of sets up the AI to know what this is going. All right, I want to build methodology. Brilliant. Oh, this is what I found. Click, click, and you're like, oh, that's awesome. Yes, that, or something. And you maybe have a little prompt, which you write. I love that one, that one, that one. Click on go, and it writes it for you. And you're like, that was damn good. Copy and paste. Exactly. I'm just imagining kind of like, it's a co-pilot. 00:24:50 Speaker 5 It is a co-pilot. It's not like the writer. It's like the assistant. How can we build a system which helps you write better. 00:24:57 Speaker 6 We can. 00:24:58 Speaker 5 And service information which is relevant to you, and gives you insights you can think of yourself, or just speeds up that process. 00:25:05 Speaker 3 Yeah. Because the hassle is. The hassle in this is not necessarily the writing of it. It's finding the back, you know. 00:25:12 Speaker 5 And that's a great point. I was wrestling with this thought too. Like, do we really want a click, write, rewrite, rewrite, not good enough, try again, no. 00:25:22 Speaker 2 What's important. 00:25:23 Speaker 5 Yeah. We almost want to. 00:25:25 Speaker 2 They almost need a knowledge base to some extent. Yeah, yeah, that's it. They actually have, this is what we did the last five times. 00:25:31 Speaker 5 It is like the AI intern, right? That's like right there for you. And so then us designing and fishing out what that looked like and how do we get to a great thing. And you guys must have used two screens, or some of you might have used three. Three. Yeah, three is great. So you might have a screen where you're in proposal mode, word document here, copilot here, and we need to figure out what that screen looks like. Yeah. And you're probably gonna have an AI application, which is your copilot, and then this proposal copilot, and then your word document, and between that, your writing goes from four hours to an hour, 00:26:03 Speaker 5 or whatever, right? Yeah. Something like that. 00:26:06 Speaker 6 Speaking for myself, I know what I want when I see it. 00:26:09 Speaker 5 Yeah, that's it. 00:26:10 Speaker 6 But it's quicker to go, no, yes, that's what I want. 00:26:15 Speaker 5 So it's all about really good filtering, really good data, really good insights, and so for us to do that, we might have to build our own Netflix library, basically, of your, you know. That's going to be an underpinning, because data is really, really important with any AI. 00:26:27 Speaker 1 And the tagging. 00:26:29 Speaker 5 The tagging category. I think that's a really big one. 00:26:31 Speaker 1 Before we launched Co-Pilot, I did look at doing some tagging on stuff, and I looked at it, and I completely overwhelmed and ran away, because I didn't have AI to do it for me. 25 years worth of very poorly filed stuff. 00:26:44 Speaker 5 Yeah. 00:26:44 Speaker 1 Our filing is not enabling. We're not enabling. 00:26:48 Speaker 5 Yeah. I think we would get more insights as we go through this process, but I imagine, if we not just tag on a document level, but what if we created tagging and really sophisticated tagging categorization on even a section-by-section level? So then we have a matrix of the types of documents, and the sections of every document, and then you're ready. Really, when you search, you're going to get excellent, you could potentially search what was the methodology I used on eight different blah, blah, blah. I'm just trying to imagine your experience. And we, I think the direction we'll know. 00:27:18 Speaker 5 where we want to get to. The nuance of how it looks and feels is very unknown right now. But I would love to flesh it out with you guys a bit more. 00:27:25 Speaker 3 I think the more we talk, the more it becomes clear. For me, it's exactly what Karen's saying. It's like, we get paid to write stuff, so we don't want to sit there and just watch. 00:27:38 Speaker 5 Watch it. Yeah. No, because that's taking your brain, right. 00:27:42 Speaker 3 We still want to have control over that. We still want to control the language and the message. I mean, even when I read something like that, it's like, I don't need. AI to write who we're going to work with I can write that but what I do would find help with give us the broad when we've done these business cases how we've broken it down into strategic assessment, business case development even like. 00:28:12 Speaker 3 give us a flow chart like that, a real simple one that we can then just overlay the specifics of this particular job, do you know what I mean like where we use this versus that. 00:28:26 Speaker 2 they want to be able to access. 00:28:29 Speaker 5 I think that's probably one of the biggest things. 00:28:32 Speaker 6 and I think one of the things that I think our proposals don't always do is. explaining or including, What our client gets out of us doing it, the client benefit, I think there's not a lot of that always in our proposals, and it's probably one of the things that we get feedback on. The why. 00:28:56 Speaker 5 Right. 00:28:57 Speaker 6 This is what we do, but why do we do that, and what do you get out of it. 00:29:00 Speaker 5 Yeah, there possibly is actually, as I think about that, there's possibly even... like the copilot type thing which helps you write the thing and then it could even be like an AI reviewer step which you jump the whole document in and it just does an overview wash and it gives you some here's our common best practices maybe we imagine if you guys wrote a rule book of 50 golden rules on any proposal check AI just washes it and goes cool it looks pretty good but there's three recommendations again not telling you to. 00:29:31 Speaker 5 write it just telling you something and you go back to your document you go oh yeah I probably should have written cool yeah now then that version goes to your internal reviewer and it's just an you know I'm just thinking about your process like he's probably a couple of use cases they're very weak centric at the moment yeah right right outcomes the other thing while I'm thinking about it. 00:29:49 Speaker 3 sorry it's a bit of a that's okay that's yeah my brain, This stuff, you know, like if we scroll down, like from here, so we've got this down, this is our methodology, what this ultimately feeds into in terms of our process is that we build up our costs based on these phases, and we do that using a standard, like a really basic spreadsheet, and we're supposed to. 00:30:22 Speaker 6 I actually didn't know there was a spreadsheet, I've only used Project Works to do it. Oh have you? Yeah, yeah. 00:30:26 Speaker 5 Do you cost out of, do you create a job in there. 00:30:29 Speaker 6 Yeah, I put the time codes in. 00:30:30 Speaker 5 Time codes. 00:30:31 Speaker 6 And then how many hours per each. 00:30:33 Speaker 5 And that's how you price it. 00:30:34 Speaker 2 That's how I price it. 00:30:35 Speaker 5 Yeah, well, I mean. 00:30:36 Speaker 2 So there's no standardisation around that then. 00:30:39 Speaker 3 No, but traditionally what we've done is, and I think most people just use a spreadsheet. We haven't had Project Works for that long. 00:30:44 Speaker 5 Oh, I have. 00:30:44 Speaker 3 And the spreadsheet's broken down into the phases. 00:30:48 Speaker 5 Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. 00:30:50 Speaker 3 Yeah, and then you've got your phases, and then your tasks. 00:30:54 Speaker 5 It's like your work break. It's your WBS sort of breakdown structure. 00:30:58 Speaker 3 You've got your people and their rates, and that's how you build up the... 00:31:01 Speaker 2 You know the invoicing thing that we're going to build? It actually needs all of this info. So the budget that you guys are doing, right, is eventually actually what you compare when you finally... 00:31:14 Speaker 5 Invoice. 00:31:15 Speaker 2 Invoice, right? So they're almost... It needs to be able to talk to one another to that final point that we want to get to. 00:31:22 Speaker 5 Oh, we just haven't got an invoicing for a second before. Yeah, it's super interesting. 00:31:26 Speaker 6 Because where the process breaks down, Yeah, tell me. So I use ProjectWorks and I do it like this. 00:31:33 Speaker 5 So you map out all of your... 00:31:34 Speaker 6 And I allocate how many hours to each task. Yeah. To get the project budget. In ProjectWorks, so that creates like a time code for each. like step of the project that you can book your time to, but not everyone uses it. But it creates like, if you add like 10 time codes to each project on your timesheet, it's just unwieldy. So people just pick one and book all their time. 00:31:58 Speaker 3 I see, yeah. Because you end up, people go, I don't know which part I'm working on. 00:32:04 Speaker 2 So what's driving having all of that breakdown? So what's driving having it broken down to such levels? So that's just how I break it, I put the budget together. 00:32:15 Speaker 3 In an ideal world, everyone's on the same page, and everyone knew exactly what they were doing, and that they had three hours allocated to audit element three. They would just go straight in and go, I've done my three hours, or I've done one of the three hours. 00:32:28 Speaker 6 And I thought that's how the process is supposed to be. 00:32:30 Speaker 2 But if they can look at their job, on that interface that we want to build for the invoicing, if it has the job in there, and the people can go into that and look and see what's already there, what's already being done. It takes out the element of the person having to actually allocate it if we drive it differently. I'm just trying to work out how to link what you guys want to solve with what they want to solve in the same thing because I actually believe that process-wise, I know that ultimately what you do in the quoting process. 00:33:02 Speaker 2 and the proposal has eventually got to be invoiced by the last people I talk to, right? So what I'm trying to get to is how do we solve the problem just not solving your problem but their problem but all the problems link into the one solution day. Because that information there, ultimately when you come back to here and they're talking about the budget compared to the cost and all that, it's that information there that she's showing you. 00:33:30 Speaker 1 I mean, there's kind of a couple of things come to mind here. First of all, that is the very standard. That first proposal template that I showed you was very complex. a lot of them just use this it's really simple general consulting time yeah right so this is more common um one of the things that um happens a lot and it's a really good thing is that we don't necessarily track to that budget because there will be variations and additions and changes. 00:34:02 Speaker 1 so in our world it's it's a really good thing when a project changes from a thirty thousand dollar proposal to a sixty thousand dollar in project work so just in terms of tracking budgets. 00:34:14 Speaker 2 i guess what i'm trying to get the only thing i want dave to actually click is that that input right at the very beginning is actually at the end as well yeah yeah that's where i want to bring i know what you're saying in terms of budget i'm not specifically talking about tracking but the invoice does show that information, Not the invoice. 00:34:40 Speaker 3 I wasn't in that conversation. This is a bit of a rabbit hole because what I was trying to get at, right, was that just, when we're coming up with a price, right, forgetting about you're either doing an Excel. 00:34:55 Speaker 5 you're doing it in Project Works, which might get declined and you might delete that job later or whatever. 00:35:00 Speaker 6 Yeah, we're going to have to do that. It's converting that into data. 00:35:08 Speaker 5 Into the statement of works. 00:35:11 Speaker 3 So that we don't have to go, oh, I've just written all this. Now I've got to go and rewrite all this. 00:35:15 Speaker 5 But you potentially could actually have AI do that for you. 00:35:17 Speaker 2 That's what I was trying to get to, was that you could actually use the source input from the proposal to create the statement of works, which then goes into the invoice. 00:35:27 Speaker 5 Definitely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 00:35:29 Speaker 2 That's what I was trying to highlight. 00:35:30 Speaker 3 Because if I get this, right? Yeah. And I get it as a list with a hierarchy of category and then tasks and stuff. I know what you mean, yeah. And then I can actually go straight to doing that. Because once I've written this methodology, then I'm going down to the next section, which is how much of what are we charging for this. 00:35:52 Speaker 6 So you want that methodology summarised and you can start putting hours against it. 00:35:57 Speaker 5 Yeah, and so that... 00:35:58 Speaker 3 Even if it's just the list, and then I go, okay, these are the three people that are going to do it. 00:36:01 Speaker 5 So you almost... Yeah, okay, interesting. So if there was some sort of interface, again, that was doing this and it was helping you to find information and it was helping you to... It's almost like, again, like an interface which wrapped around your project works, in a sense. Let's say you create a new job and it did create the job in what project works. And then it's also doubling as your search engine and everything else we talked about. you now have your business case methodology and you're saying you've. 00:36:34 Speaker 5 got that you could click a button and that maybe generates a WBS draft is that what you're saying right there in the interface and you could maybe delete the rows or add rows or add new stuff or whatever yeah and then maybe it's got, people's initials or names and hours and it just calculates all right there for you even if it then you go click and it just pasted into a document so it's all done for you would you do you put those in the document or is that an internal. 00:36:57 Speaker 3 okay so you put it so you put it into it like because what I'm usually better than I want to use it to calculate how what's the price that we put it yeah so. 00:37:05 Speaker 5 you would so you would sort of serve two purposes number one it would just give you a price and number two you'd go maybe go save and it would write the document the data back to the project works which saves you I mean to enter if. 00:37:15 Speaker 6 you wanted to if you would yeah if it's a large enough project will price it. 00:37:21 Speaker 3 per phase per phase but yeah I can't remember what I did I don't know whether we did one for this one, you, I think we do, sometimes we don't do it, sometimes we do it. 00:37:31 Speaker 5 Okay, that's interesting. So essentially it's like your job costing, so turning your proposal into a work breakdown structure which helps you cost it. And so then there's a bit of smarts around. Okay, to do that would be innocent of your people, of your. 00:37:47 Speaker 3 Yeah, here we go, do the second one, do the second one. 00:37:48 Speaker 5 So for AI to do that well, we would have to have a great data set around your people, your names, your capabilities, maybe, or like past jobs. 00:37:58 Speaker 6 I think we would pick the people. 00:37:59 Speaker 5 You would pick the people? We would pick the people. That makes it easier to have to train. 00:38:02 Speaker 6 Because it's resourcing and work-wise. 00:38:04 Speaker 5 But you maybe just put some roles, maybe. We have these types of roles in our business. AI maybe goes, this was the last. Maybe you can have a work breakdown structure tied as examples of previous work as well. If we're going to build that database. 00:38:17 Speaker 3 Because a lot of this stuff, like project initiation, is pretty much the same. 00:38:21 Speaker 2 Standard. 00:38:22 Speaker 3 Yeah. We always have a kick-off meeting and we always allow for review of background. 00:38:27 Speaker 5 Project management. Yeah. 00:38:28 Speaker 3 But do you see how that's just kind of a facsimile of some of that stuff? Yeah. And that allows us to then... 00:38:35 Speaker 6 Yeah, but we do it manually. Yeah. 00:38:37 Speaker 3 Well, I've had to copy and paste or rewrite these into this spreadsheet. 00:38:44 Speaker 5 Yeah, so if AI could generate something like that in a web-based interface. And maybe there's an Excel spreadsheet. Maybe there's an Excel export function, which generated it. You've kind of, again, it's like the idea of taking 90% of the work out. Maybe it reads your whole proposal and it goes, boom. And you're like, sweet, that's pretty good. I'll make a couple of tweaks, export, and you're already there. And then you're like, great. So it's all just time-saving. So then the question becomes, how do we make sure that that's as quality as possible? 00:39:15 Speaker 5 So I think it would be relatively straightforward to create a list. The hard part, well, the hard part is they make a great list. And that's just where the better the data and the better the prompting, the better the examples, all that kind of stuff. It's great. Would this document end up living in your SharePoint and is it used at all in the project, like actual delivery. 00:39:34 Speaker 3 No. 00:39:34 Speaker 5 It's just literally for you. 00:39:36 Speaker 3 Well it's for us to figure out like... 00:39:39 Speaker 5 The PM wouldn't refer to it. 00:39:41 Speaker 3 You refer to it! No, that we only use it to figure out what we're going to put in the SharePoint. 00:39:46 Speaker 5 But the project manager on the job wouldn't necessarily open it up again, it would just click dust. No. 00:39:51 Speaker 2 So it's literally just used to quote to get the job and then... 00:39:57 Speaker 3 Well that spreadsheet is, but I think Karen you were saying... 00:39:59 Speaker 6 When I do it in Project Works, I cost my time against those time codes and then I can compare what hours I allocated versus how long it took. And in theory, get better at costing by seeing the time. 00:40:15 Speaker 2 Yeah, and I'm guessing the people in Excel are not looking at that at all, they'd be just... 00:40:20 Speaker 5 There's a little bit of, so how would you manage, let's say you solve this project, how would you then project manage it, would you then, do you manually put that all into Project Works, or does someone else do that, or is there eventually like a project list in Project Works which you manage again. 00:40:33 Speaker 3 Well, Project Works is completely flexible, so you can come up with a, like I could have built that whole structure there, but I don't, because when we've done that in the past, and we've got multiple people working on it, what I've ended up with is someone's gone into that, if you open that spreadsheet up again... 00:40:53 Speaker 5 It's probably the exact same as our issue internally. Yeah, and other people could like it. You have 25 tickets or whatever, and everyone just puts their time on three, and they just have no budget. Yeah, and then you're like, oh, are we creating a problem? This looks great, you put two hours and two hours, but you're supposed to be doing five of these things at the same time, and it's like just a day, and you're like, do I put two, or do I put ten hours. 00:41:16 Speaker 2 So is that more like a tool to work out how to price the job, as a pricing tool, rather than anything else? Karen's just going to another level with this. 00:41:27 Speaker 6 You could probably put like phase one, phase two, phase three in protein. 00:41:30 Speaker 5 Yeah, that's, you're literally just doing the same, same as us and now Turnly, right? We're suddenly building a firewall. It's actually like 25 steps. The dude's doing it at like two full days. He's not, we might budget at two hours, two hours, two hours, two hours, two hours. He's not gonna wanna go in and out of 10 tickets to write timesheets. 00:41:50 Speaker 3 No, yeah. 00:41:51 Speaker 5 I know, it's the same, same idea, I think. 00:41:54 Speaker 3 Yeah, so what we will end up doing is we, I mean, that's a sort of just a general one, but you could actually say, I'm gonna take that and repeat it three times for phase one, phase two. 00:42:06 Speaker 5 phase three. 00:42:06 Speaker 3 That would be how I would generally approach it. 00:42:09 Speaker 6 Yeah, yeah, that's a better one. 00:42:10 Speaker 1 Yeah, okay, so this is one of Alice's templates. So she's got. 00:42:14 Speaker 5 Kick off, projects, review. So yeah, these might represent pieces of work. 00:42:18 Speaker 1 where you're, there are a lot of stuff. And then people actually have to code their time on that. 00:42:23 Speaker 5 And they're scheduled. Yeah, and their time. 00:42:25 Speaker 1 And quite frankly, if they don't, the project may- manager will kick their butt, and next time, they'll put it in the right place. 00:42:31 Speaker 5 So there is two different things, one's a project works set up, one's a costing tool. You don't really need the Excel spreadsheets just there as it leads to an end, so could the AI platform generate a cost, quick and easy. 00:42:43 Speaker 1 We use these templates in project works to do the costing. So on this particular one, exactly what Matt's doing in the Excel role, I'm going to say, I'm going to add... Myself, and then I'm going to estimate three hours, and it'll cost it up for me. So to Karen's point, if I've estimated, so this is a template, so I don't actually want to save over it, but if I, when I start working on the job, I can see that I estimated four hours, and I can see that I've done eight hours worth of work, so actually it's better. 00:43:15 Speaker 1 Whereas if it's just a one-off in Excel that no one's ever looking at again, and I don't have that tracking, so I think it's way better in project mode. 00:43:23 Speaker 3 So do I, but I'm just saying that the reality of it is, is that it only really works perfectly across the whole business if everyone can understand exactly which, whether they're working on 5A or 5B, and how many hours they've got allocated to it, and that's just not the case. 00:43:42 Speaker 2 So see those steps, one, two, three, and all that, are they standard across every project? No. 00:43:47 Speaker 5 No, no, no. 00:43:47 Speaker 2 And they're specific based on the methodology, correct. 00:43:51 Speaker 5 Yes. Yep. 00:43:52 Speaker 6 This is one that we're working on at the moment. So this is one of mine where I've done it, I've allocated the hours, time entered, time allocated. 00:44:01 Speaker 3 Yeah but even this one is like, we blew it out, we blew out that one. And Gareth and I, this is one I was about to bring up because Gareth and I were like, oh my god, because you were away on holiday, having fun, and in the meantime we were blowing out your budget. 00:44:23 Speaker 5 And then the 0.5 hours, I was going to 16, and I'm like, wow. 00:44:26 Speaker 6 No, that's the other way around, I allocated 16, but... 00:44:28 Speaker 5 Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, of course. No one's used that one, but that's like, they've charged the elsewhere and stuff. I see, yeah, I see. 00:44:34 Speaker 2 Yeah, it's where they've put it, so they'll just... 00:44:36 Speaker 5 3A has gone up, yeah. 00:44:37 Speaker 2 But do you guys actually want to get to that real detailed level. 00:44:41 Speaker 5 Not everybody at the Pins on Approach is going to do that. 00:44:42 Speaker 2 No, because I don't think we want to mandate it. Can I tell you... Okay, that's where I was trying to work out. 00:44:48 Speaker 1 I'm just going to look back to invoicing, though. When this gets invoiced, it's got one budget. Yes. The budget is professional services time. Yes, yeah, yeah. And that's the total. 00:44:58 Speaker 2 It's a sub-item, so it will consolidate. 00:45:00 Speaker 5 As long as the total is hit a level. 00:45:02 Speaker 2 But that total, you do actually put on the invoice, though. 00:45:05 Speaker 5 Yeah. 00:45:05 Speaker 2 As where I was going, yeah. 00:45:07 Speaker 1 Yeah, but all of these things are consolidated because that is a budget. We do have some jobs that have multiple budgets. Yeah. So phase one, phase two, phase three will be separate budgets. So these are activities under a budget. 00:45:19 Speaker 5 Under a budget, yeah. 00:45:20 Speaker 1 Yeah. So this detail goes nowhere near the... 00:45:22 Speaker 2 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 00:45:23 Speaker 5 The same as our system. 00:45:24 Speaker 2 But I guess where I was going was that if you've got the information in the system, then we need the last thing to pull the information rather than get it from anywhere else was where I was going. I wanted to make sure that we were streamlining. 00:45:37 Speaker 3 One of the problems that I've found with Project Works is it looks great here and it looks, you know, like as a PM this is a really helpful view. But when you're entering time, I've got to go in and I've got to go Project, you know, A, B, C, 1, 2, 3 and then I've got to pick one of these and then I've got to pin it to my timesheet and then if it changes... That's why people put their time in the wrong place, because the first one they use will be like, oh yeah, I'm just going to put my time against that job number. 00:46:08 Speaker 3 But that's just laziness. I'm going to be honest. Well, no, it's not just laziness, and it's not just laziness, because people don't, people don't know, like if you're working on 1B, you don't even know that there's a 5A necessarily. You don't, you don't, you know, like you don't. 00:46:23 Speaker 1 But if you're not working on it, you need to know, yeah. 00:46:25 Speaker 3 Because you, because you, we're getting people, like I might get Matt Johnson to do a part of 3A, you know. 00:46:30 Speaker 6 Yeah. 00:46:30 Speaker 3 And then he, and then later on I'm asking him to do something else, and it might be part of 5C. And if I don't tell him, put it against 5C. 00:46:37 Speaker 6 Yeah, he'll put it anywhere. 00:46:38 Speaker 3 He'll just put it, he'll put it against 3A, because he'll be like, oh, it's just that job. 00:46:41 Speaker 6 If I'm, if I'm brutally honest. 00:46:42 Speaker 3 Got it. 00:46:43 Speaker 6 I think the worst people are the directors. Yeah. Because in their timesheet, they've got like 20 projects, and if they've got 10 time codes for each project, we don't want them spending two hours during their timesheet. 00:46:57 Speaker 2 And you also, yeah, I was just going to say that, you actually don't want them, and you don't actually, where I was trying to get to is you actually don't even want it on that specific detail level, do you really. 00:47:07 Speaker 7 No. 00:47:08 Speaker 2 Well, I do. Some do and some don't. So maybe you want to be able to, yeah, they need to have the choice whether they can drill down or not. I just know that as a project manager. As an accountant, I would want to know if I was making money or not, right? So our young, my assistant who we automated is now our ops coordinator. Oh my goodness, has that been a great move because does she care about that budget? She does. 00:47:36 Speaker 1 Karen is an exception in those very detailed ones. This is a lot more common. It's just general consulting time, boom, that's it. And that's what it goes to. 00:47:51 Speaker 5 And there's always ways, again, when you've got an API into a system there's potential for a future to enter time in a third party system, like a custom, which makes it easier. That would be another job, potentially an enhancement on the invoicing system, it could be a time entry system, and a way better, again, the same way that we're abstracting. drilling into a job to find the right thing. Maybe there's a way of it being displayed differently and make it easier, whatever. 00:48:22 Speaker 5 But that's another, probably another project, yeah. 00:48:26 Speaker 1 I'm not sure this is a curveball or not, but we use Zoho as our CRM system. Zoho CRM. So tracking opportunities. Yes. When we get to proposal development, we move it into the proposal stage, it asks us if we want to create in Project Works. 00:48:43 Speaker 5 And is this an automation you guys have built yourself. 00:48:45 Speaker 1 Yeah. 00:48:46 Speaker 5 Oh, cool. Or it's like there's a built-in integration between them, or is it custom. 00:48:50 Speaker 1 No, it's custom. Yeah. Nice. And they don't talk to each other. So in Zoho, if we've got an opportunity, and it's going into proposal development, we can ask it to generate a proposal template so we can go do our costing. It only uses, not everybody, we've got a choice in there, yes, no, because Karen wouldn't want to use this because she likes her detailed proposal, she might just duplicate one she's already done. It uses the most basic, it uses this. 00:49:22 Speaker 5 Does it tag it against the customer? Is the customer records the same. 00:49:28 Speaker 1 They do, they are supposed to update each other, but it's not. Okay, yeah, okay. No, it's supposed to be two-way, but it's... 00:49:39 Speaker 5 The only reason I know is because I know CRM, and we used to have it ourselves. We didn't end up finding a need for it after a while, but having it for a few years was great. As at Deluge, they've got their own language for writing scripts. 00:49:57 Speaker 1 I'm just going to cancel that because I don't want to actually move this. This is somebody's job. 00:50:03 Speaker 3 Yeah, fair enough. 00:50:05 Speaker 1 So it does, but as I say, it just goes to this. So if we're going to look at anything that automates it, we want to just keep in the back of our minds that there is already a way to. 00:50:18 Speaker 3 And that's why I think just generating the structure. It's not even doing the costing for us. It's the structure of how the project's broken down. And you can choose whether or not you build it into here or not. 00:50:30 Speaker 5 Right, yeah, I think that's a good point, yeah. Where the data lives is different than the data being generated, as we're saying. Yeah. 00:50:39 Speaker 6 I would love to get to the point where it could say. 00:50:42 Speaker 3 Yeah, but that could be a choice step, though. 00:50:44 Speaker 6 Yeah, but because we don't have the timesheet data in that detail, I don't think we've got the database to be able to cost it. 00:50:53 Speaker 3 Oh I see what you mean, what I'm getting at is that you write a methodology and then, rather than you having to then duplicate it to turn it into a breakdown it just does that and then you can from there that's your platform or your springboard to decide whether or not you got what automation you might build on to the back of that but you don't have to do that straight away. 00:51:16 Speaker 6 No, no. But yeah, that's where my ideal would be. 00:51:21 Speaker 3 Yeah, how much is this going to cost. 00:51:23 Speaker 6 Yeah, yeah. How many hours did we take on this last time? Forget about what we told them we were going to do. How many hours did it actually take? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we don't have the database. 00:51:33 Speaker 5 On a similar job. So then that comes down to where that data is so useful. 00:51:38 Speaker 7 Yeah. 00:51:39 Speaker 5 Having like your proposals and your actuals all kind of in some database, which is searchable, findable, whatever. 00:51:47 Speaker 6 And that's fine. 00:51:48 Speaker 5 And then serve that up to you as someone who's trying to build the next one. 00:51:51 Speaker 6 Yeah, yeah. 00:51:51 Speaker 5 Having all that data. What if that looks like right now? But we can explore different interfaces and different ways of exploring that. But I'm just imagining. 00:51:59 Speaker 1 We can do that in a spreadsheet. 00:52:01 Speaker 5 Like what if you used your matrix and you had, yeah, customer name. And then you clicked on the matrix what service line it was, boom, and that immediately serves up everything relevant to you, based on the sections, your track record, it's already pre-written, or pre, I'm just trying to imagine what that could look like. 00:52:20 Speaker 2 Especially with the service lines and the ones that you said are very common, that would do most of the work. It's only on the stuff that's exceptional that we would need more and more human intervention. Because you're saying there's lots of commonality, right, in what the methodology, if you've got similar jobs. 00:52:39 Speaker 6 Some commonality, yeah, I'm nervous about that, not too much. but i think even from the track record that's where i think yeah that's what i was going to. 00:52:48 Speaker 2 say if you've got seven jobs where you've done the same thing maybe the ai can pick out the. 00:52:53 Speaker 5 two things that are similar i reckon i reckon like as a next steps it'd be great because i'm also mindful of like the time in terms of like it's 11. um i reckon next steps would be so interesting to sit down with you for a whole another hour just like one-on-one and go through. 00:53:08 Speaker 6 a proposal and go through those sections just based on what i need though because it's going. 00:53:13 Speaker 5 to be yeah but i i think maybe i also i think there's probably a case to have maybe two or three, interviews or it could be a half an hour an hour um where we dig into these points the most important points that work break down like the methodology the track record and i don't know if um if you're able to even share some example proposals to us because it could be scratched out or whatever i don't mind, Just so we can read them, because I'd be interested in the human eyeball 10 examples, because then. 00:53:43 Speaker 5 I could start to look at them and go, what can we see as an external party, as similarities, and differences, and start getting a sense of the data. And also start getting a sense of, I'll be interested in even quantities of proposals and things like that. Because if we're going to build a proof of concept around this, or even just propose a proof of concept around this, I'd love to be really clear on what this could look like and feel like, and we might be able to pull together a really, really basic proof of concept as part of our scope here around this. 00:54:12 Speaker 2 So I'm correct, right, that your two big real pain points and things you want to solve with this is the methodology and the track record. 00:54:20 Speaker 5 And then pricing breakdown. 00:54:22 Speaker 2 Yeah, the pricing breakdown's, I'm guessing, secondary, right. 00:54:26 Speaker 5 Yeah, secondary. 00:54:26 Speaker 2 So it's really about focusing on those two things. If you solve the methodology, you can get the pricings from it, right? If we can solve those two things and make it easier, that would be a win for that. That's what you're looking for. 00:54:39 Speaker 6 Yes, I would add to that, though. So our understanding of your requirements or our understanding of your needs. Yeah. But that's going to take more user input. Yes, and that's, yeah. But we, so we have a table of our brand messages. 00:54:54 Speaker 5 Yeah, okay. 00:54:55 Speaker 6 Okay. Which I've found really helpful. So, if we've had the conversation with the client, we can take, you know, half a dozen dot points around, you know, what's important to them. 00:55:05 Speaker 5 Yeah, and your transcripts from meetings, and a few things. 00:55:08 Speaker 6 And you can combine it with our brand messages. 00:55:10 Speaker 5 That could spread out. 00:55:11 Speaker 6 Yeah, and I'll co-pilot to pick two or three. If you tell it to use all of it, but it sounds really cheesy. 00:55:17 Speaker 5 because it's just a usable thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 00:55:19 Speaker 6 Pick three of the brand messages that are most relevant to this project, and weave them into our understanding of your requirements. 00:55:25 Speaker 5 That's amazing. So, I think, yeah, if you look at those three things, then. So, understanding your requirements, the methodology, and then the third thing. 00:55:31 Speaker 2 The brand message. 00:55:33 Speaker 5 To make a, like, then we kind of, we might say, to make a great understanding section. the inputs you would need are A, B, C, D, E. And then what's the human and the AI part? And then how do we get, you know, you might need to have a slight tweak in your process. Okay, we're gonna record our meetings, and then we could have an interface where you literally say, upload your transcripts, click and drag the three, and then select your blah, click a button, and then that generates something for you. Or something, you know, there's a workflow. 00:56:05 Speaker 5 which we could build. 00:56:06 Speaker 6 There's an input in that, our understanding of your requirements, which is not from the client, and not from our brand messages, but from our understanding of the industry. 00:56:17 Speaker 5 Yeah, there's also that, which is really interesting. Yeah. 00:56:19 Speaker 6 We understand that this, you know, change in legislation's gonna impact what you're doing in this area. 00:56:25 Speaker 5 That would be your brain dump bullet point. You know, you're gonna mix a bunch of bullet points. But the other thing that we know. 00:56:30 Speaker 6 that we need to take into account. 00:56:32 Speaker 5 Yeah, yeah. 00:56:33 Speaker 3 But I would say a big percentage of our jobs, would be a decent chunk would be playing back the email yeah all right so there's. 00:56:47 Speaker 5 also the input from the client which is typically an email and then you go and then you just. 00:56:51 Speaker 3 you basically are playing it back playing it back almost verbatim you know so that's that and you're adding on to it yeah yeah exactly yeah awesome that's your that's sort of your basic that's great you needed that you need these three things and this is you. 00:57:05 Speaker 5 know this is how we understood those based on abc and ai helps to helps to bring a together yeah so it is that yeah so it's almost like the proposal is broken down into into three major pieces some of it's templated but there's like one two three pieces which are need take ages to write and the reason is because it basically takes ages to write secondly because for some of it you've got to go hunting for data and ask your colleagues and we and i can help minimize all that and in the third part i can help break down work, into work breakdown structures and estimates and all sorts. 00:57:37 Speaker 5 So there's a lot of heavy lifting that AI can do. None of it's taking away from your actual thoughts or your consulting. It's just the stuff you'd be doing anyway. It's just time consuming crap. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. And it feels like, and then you remain in the driver's seat. You're still completely in control. 00:57:53 Speaker 3 We don't, we don't. 00:57:54 Speaker 5 All the wins with no. 00:57:54 Speaker 3 I just don't see a world. No. 00:57:56 Speaker 5 Yeah, no, I 100% agree. 00:57:57 Speaker 3 Where you just go, write me a proposal for this and it comes out. 00:58:01 Speaker 5 Magic, yeah. 00:58:01 Speaker 3 And it's gonna be, and it's gonna be what they need. Yeah. Because the other thing we've gotta be aware of as well with proposals is it's our connection with our client. And so if they pick it up and go, you just got AI to write this. Yeah. It's like my son doing an essay on AI, you know, without actually, you know, just handing it in. It's kinda obvious. 00:58:23 Speaker 5 Yeah, yeah. You have to ask AI to make at least one spelling mistake. 00:58:26 Speaker 3 Yeah, yeah. 00:58:27 Speaker 5 It's a dead giveaway. 00:58:30 Speaker 3 Well, I've actually had two instances where we've done stuff, and because we've done proposals that the client said, it's almost like you won't use AI to write it. And I was like, funny you said that, because we actually didn't. And it was because we were almost, we didn't put enough of our own, like, yeah. 00:58:49 Speaker 5 AI must have learned from you guys. That's a compliment. You know, AI's writing must have learned from your proposal. Like, no, that's a compliment, guys. We're so good at writing that. 00:58:59 Speaker 3 Take it as such, I suppose. But it was more that it was, the feedback on one of them was like, it didn't really show that you kind of. what you as a company, you know, like, your special source. Really, right. Because it was almost too, like... Generic. 00:59:19 Speaker 2 It's funny you say that. We tried to, for our AI division, we tried to create a strategic plan, and the first one we came up with, Dave did the AI, and it was so generic. It was just useless, wasn't it? We didn't use it at all. But it just had no humanness to it, or no thought. 00:59:38 Speaker 5 Yeah, yeah, 100%. 00:59:40 Speaker 2 I mean, it was a good try. 00:59:42 Speaker 5 It was great at it, and a lot of things the AI's not great at. 00:59:44 Speaker 2 Yeah, and that is creativity. 00:59:47 Speaker 5 But yeah, I think that's a great session. I think we could probably call it there. 00:59:51 Speaker 1 I was trying to count the number of proposals, but it's a little bit tricky. I can tell you there were 133 new jobs in 12 months. 133 new jobs, okay. But I can't see how many proposals we didn't get. And I was looking in the proposals folder, but it's folders... By client, I was hoping just to do a quick count. 01:00:09 Speaker 2 Would you hit rate 50-50? No, it would be higher. It would be like 75%. Really? Nice. 01:00:16 Speaker 6 We don't tender a lot. 01:00:17 Speaker 2 No, because you're pretty much asked to propose. Yeah. Prepare us a proposal for this. Yeah, Aussie tenders a lot if we do, yeah. If you assumed probably 75%? Yeah. 01:00:27 Speaker 3 I'd say... 01:00:28 Speaker 2 So that means you're doing 200 a year, basically. 01:00:32 Speaker 3 Yeah, but they take a fair whack of time, don't they? Yeah, they do. I would say, you know, so that's each one of us, you know. 01:00:39 Speaker 2 You could say, so these three things... 01:00:41 Speaker 5 Is it 200 proposals across the group? Yeah. So 200 proposals, how many consultants? That's a guess, 27. 27. 01:00:47 Speaker 3 Yeah, but there's also a whole lot of email proposals as well. Yeah, exactly. 01:00:52 Speaker 5 Because that's probably more than... Oh, yeah. Because that only... It's a new job. Right. We've basically got new jobs. Yeah. Because that only... Well, it's only about seven a month, seven a year, eight per year per person, but that doesn't sound like... Is that more than that. 01:01:03 Speaker 6 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But if you're going off new jobs though, not all of those would have a proposal like this associated with them. So maybe it's tricky. 01:01:14 Speaker 3 But these are the big ones, these are the problems. 01:01:15 Speaker 6 Yeah, I was going to say, it's a bigger job that you would propose. Yeah, I wonder if that's it. I wonder if you could look at the budgets and see how many of those new jobs were over 25k or something. 01:01:26 Speaker 3 Because I'm not writing a five-page proposal for a job that... Like when Auckland Council, for example, will bring us and say, can you do a peer review of this piece of work? A few grand, and it's like, yeah, and I'm not going to write them a six-page document like that. 01:01:43 Speaker 6 Cover all of that stuff. Make sure they've got something for their file that says, this is what we're going to do, and who's going to do it, and how much it's going to cost. 01:01:51 Speaker 5 That's really cool. That's awesome. I think in terms of just next steps, I think that we should do a couple more, two or three more meetings. It probably is great to have another one-on-one with both of you. Is there another person we should be engaging on your team, just in terms of a different perspective. 01:02:06 Speaker 3 Yeah, because the Aussies, because they're doing tendering a lot more. They do a lot of tendering. Government state requirements. Well, it's because the Aussies are dodgy, right? We're actually only half-joking there. Yeah, I'm married to one. I'm married to one. I know, I know. They've had to, like, over the years, they've had to actually be really half-joking. 01:02:32 Speaker 2 There's all sorts of policies. Yeah, you know, corruption within the state government. That's what you're talking about, right. 01:02:38 Speaker 3 Well, yeah, like, in local government, it's like, kind of, you know, giving your mates, like, you know... ten million dollar contracts you know here's a pie full of money underneath. right yeah all that's gone on in the past and that's why they're there right so they're a lot more strained around like having to go out to market yeah being and doing the same procurement. 01:03:00 Speaker 5 prices and all that sort of stuff yeah interesting so maybe why not maybe ann could help us facilitate some some names or introductions we can do some teams meetings um we have at least a couple more meetings you know it could be 30 to 45 minutes each doesn't have to be too long yeah just going. 01:03:17 Speaker 2 through the project over in aussie or do you just do something you're just in new south wales yeah okay we've done over the years we've done other states but you have decided just new south wales, Our office isn't sitting there. Yeah, it just makes it easier. 01:03:30 Speaker 5 Yeah, it's big. 01:03:32 Speaker 2 Yeah, there's plenty of work in New South Wales alone. 01:03:34 Speaker 5 It's like the whole country of New Zealand just by itself, right, again, over there. 01:03:38 Speaker 1 Yeah. Out of interest of the 130, 91 were over 25k. OK. Yeah, just as an interest. Does anyone need a coffee or tea to pass? Definitely, probably. I'm all good, but I'm going to fill up my water bottle. 01:03:54 Speaker 5 Is there any other meetings we should have? Maybe another couple of consultants we should catch up with on this one? Any other names that come to mind. 01:04:03 Speaker 1 No, I just think we need one Aussie. 01:04:04 Speaker 5 One Aussie. And any other people in the business regarding this? No, just you guys. 01:04:10 Speaker 1 Proposals? Yeah. No, I don't think we don't want too many cooks. No, all good? Yeah. 01:04:17 Speaker 3 Yeah, and Dan would get a bit stroppy if we pulled people out to put too much. I think it's generic enough. Between Karen and myself and someone from Aussie, you're not going to hear anything new, I don't think, from anyone else. We all have to do it, so we all know what's. And it's all pretty standard, isn't it. 01:04:44 Speaker 6 I think we probably will have it developed. 01:05:20 Speaker 3 And then you go and actually have to... you actually have to turn it into something usable and it's still another you know few hours work tracking it down rewriting it so that it's fit for purpose you know like the blurb you know because, i i for years i've been like why can't we just write it write track records it's closing out the, it's part of closing out the project right like that so that we can access it i think we're. 01:05:48 Speaker 6 supposed to but we don't but no one does but that's where i think that yeah i can help with advantage of actually so instead of being a generic blurb about the project you can actually copilot or customize it to what the need is yeah that's what's important and because it can do it. 01:06:05 Speaker 5 because of the context that it can access right yeah so then if we could if we can essentially, package that context into a system like copilot but tailor it even better or tell me if i'm. 01:06:17 Speaker 6 fitting a square peg in a round hole yeah don't make stuff up just to make it fit that's right. 01:06:22 Speaker 5 So I think there's just any questions for you, Sandeep, on that. 01:06:25 Speaker 4 I have a question about the methodology. 01:06:28 Speaker 5 Oh, the methodology. 01:06:29 Speaker 4 I think we can discuss it later, right. 01:06:32 Speaker 5 Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. Just in terms of how it's derived. 01:06:37 Speaker 4 Methodology building, what are the... I saw you have a few assessments, so how you decide which assessment should propose. 01:06:50 Speaker 5 I might run to the bathroom. 01:06:52 Speaker 1 Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then... Dan, did you want another coffee. 01:06:54 Speaker 5 I might... 01:06:54 Speaker 1 Oh, is that a bad idea with your brain. 01:06:56 Speaker 5 I think brain, yeah. I think water's good for me. 01:07:00 Speaker 1 Oh, OK. 01:07:01 Speaker 5 I think water's good for me. 01:07:02 Speaker 1 That's good. All right.
